Immaculate in every way and beautiful bedding and towels.If you haven't tried a stay in one of their hotels then I suggest you try because they have made me a very happy and satisfied client.Keep up the great work and the very high standards.Thank you for a nice stay.\n",

We were in town for a family wedding that began on Friday evening and went through Saturday night. The hotel has a complementary shuttle service that is on a \"demand\" basis. We were comfortably shuttled about to all of our functions without every moving our car! To add to the experience---a very nice buffet (complementary) breakfast---complete with espresso/cappuccino!\n",

      "  Review : The hotel is located in a very busy street of Buckhead, around construction area, and can easily miss if your not looking for it. The sign is small and it was covered by cars turning left to the next street but if you see the Homewood suites, its next to it. We came in about an hour early but the clerk that check us in was nice enough to give us a room since it was pouring rain outside. Our room is in the second floor, near the elevator and can hear people outside talking or laughing but is spacious for me and my husband, got a little refrigerator and single keurig coffee but there is coffee in the lobby as well with cappucino, espresso and different types of flavored cream as well as tea 24hrs. The amenities in the room is good but the AC/heat is very noisy and difficult to adjust. The bathroom is okay but dated, i can see the stain in the bathtub but its clean and the water pressure was fine for me. The pillows are plenty and too soft for me and the bed is hard, difficult for me to sleep but my husband slept through it. We had a king bed in the hotel, but maybe I wasn't use to it since we have queen at home. There is a small bar in the lobby which I used on our first night to order fuzzy navel, but I think the bartender didn't know how to make it since he had to google it and it taste more as an orange juice than a cocktail. It was on a week day when we arrive so there was hardly anyone there but towards the week end, there was little more people hanging there in the bar laughing which strangely enough I can hear them all the way up in second floor. Maybe because of the renovation going on.The breakfast was good the first day but next day and the day after, it was the same. Would be nice if there was a pancake or french toast instead of waffle every single day we were there but the coffee was good. The people that's working on the breakfast was very nice and helpful so were each of the front desk people we've met. We did not try the pool and whirlpool since it was raining and cold but i can see it being busy in summer time. Over all, I would probably stay here again if the price is right and the surrounding area construction are done.\n",

      "  Review : Wingate is great for several reasons. I particularly like their shuttle. After driving all day, it's great to be able to leave our car parked at the hotel and take their shuttle to go to dinner (total cost: driver's tip). The wood floor in the rooms is another great feature--it helps us breathe better by keeping the room cleaner and smelling good. The rooms and bathroom are nice, beds are comfortable. Breakfast is varied and includes omelets made to order. After a busy day, we enjoyed sitting by the pool and eating an absolutely delicious meal we ordered from their menu (limited, but with good choices). Staff is unfailingly very friendly. Parking is a bit tight at the end of the day, but we get there usually before night time and have had no problem finding a space. \n",

It is clean, comfortable, and I had a huge room just for me. The staff was pleasant and very helpful when I was looking for food close by. I will patronize the business again. And the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the building is under renovation construction, so it was a bit messy. Otherwise it was perfect. \n",

      "  Review : The hotel is on a main road, which is good for finding it but bad in terms of road noise. Right now, the hotel is undergoing renovation/updating, which is really needed. The main floor public areas have been done and are quite nice. The included breakfast was a hot buffet and was good. The elevators are working but are like traveling in a cardboard box since walls are covered. My room had mismatched furniture with an odd layout of furnishings. The floors are a laminate which wasn't put down terribly well. Walls are a garish color and the granite used in the bathroom is dated. Dresser and desk are somewhat beat up, so I am hoping that all of this gets replaced in the renovation. If you are a late sleeper or need to sleep during the day, don't stay here until the renovation is done. (This wasn't a problem for me.) For the $150 I paid per night, I guess it's okay - location drives up the price. You aren't near a MARTA station, which is a drawback for me, but there is onsite free parking.\n",

The lock on the door was broken. The WIFI didn’t reach my room. I was traveling for business and needed WIFI service so I had to use my personal hotspot. The bathroom was dirty. The shower had mold and yellow stains in the tub. The fixtures were hung up crooked. The AC didn't work in my room. It looks like there was little to no effort put into this room. I wouldn’t absolutely not recommend this hotel based on my stay. This place needs a complete deep clean. I hope you can take this information and use it so your next guests stay isn’t anything like mine.\n",

It is very convenient to GA 400 and you don't have to valet park. The rooms have wood floors with really nice area rugs which just feels cleaner. They offer a Courtesy Car which will take you within 3 miles of the property which is super nice after a long drive in. We could stay anywhere we wish in Buckhead, but we prefer The Wingate. I feel very safe there and look forward to seeing the staff who have become like family over the years. They are a rare property that has little to no turnover. \n",

      "  Review : The reason I chose this hotel is because they provided transportation to chastain amphitheater. My lone complaint is I had the handicap access room without a tub. I realize this was more an issue of booking the room through an app instead of directly with the hotel but being told after I arrived and not being able to switch was really annoying. The room was clean and perfectly located. The shuttle drive was great and ushered a bunch of super fans from all over the country safely to and from the concert. There was construction but still plenty of parking so overall a good stay.\n",

      "  Review : My husband and I will be relocating to Atlanta soon and came to town for a visit. What sold us on this hotel was the free parking, which is not easy to find in Buckhead. The hotel is well maintained in the public areas and the front office staff are extremely nice and we felt very welcomed. We loved the cookies in the lobby, they were delicious. Our room was spacious and comfortable. They are doing rennovations, so upon our arrival our room had some items that should not have been in the dresser, but someone quickly came and removed them. On one of the days, our room was partially cleaned by one housekeeper and then we had to have another housekeeper come in to complete it. The bed was very comfortable and we did not experience a great deal of noise during our stay. We enjoyed the included breakfast as there was a lot to choose from and it tasted good. The parking was not always easy to do as the parking lot is narrow, but we always found a spot. The location was perfect for what we needed to accomplish during our visit and we would definitely stay at this location again if needed.\n",

      "  Review : Stayed recently for Labor Day weekend, the hotel we felt was located ideally for taking day trips to downtown and nearby shopping in Buckhead. Staff was kind and breakfast we felt was pretty decent if not setup in a nice way considering the rates for the place. Felt the pool was nice back as well. Unfortunately the elevators were down for periods of our stay and really made it inconvenient. Also as mentioned before, wear is showing in places throughout the hotel. But would still recommend for future stays and would come back. \n",

Guy they sent to fix it pushed a couple of buttons and declared it fixed (it wasn’t) Front desk employees really need to learn how to speak to and listen to customers and communicate important information. One lady in particular was quite snarky and rude. The manager seemed nice at first but was no better when it came to being faced with actual problems and not just joking around and goofing off. But maybe I’m just used to staying at hotels that actually care about their customers. Will never stay at another Wingate hotel\n",

      "  Review : We were in Atlanta for a concert at Chastain Park. We chose this hotel because it offers shuttle service to Chastain and there is free parking. Apparently a lot of people stay there for the very same reason because we met and hung out with several others on that Friday. The hotel staff was warm and friendly immediately. Marquis was amazing. He knows everything about the Buckhead area; the best places to eat, shop, etc. He also gave us the rundown on the processes and procedures at Chastain, so we had no surprises. The shuttle driver was also amazing. He would pick you up and drop you off anywhere within the area and he took a full bus load of us to the concert. He told us where he would pick us up at and he provided us with his number so we could call him if we needed him. It was a fun evening with new friends.The hotel lobby was nice, bright and inviting. The pool and whirlpool were also nice, (I used them both). The rooms, however, left a lot to be desired. Let me start by saying that they were clean, but there were signs of wear everywhere and the furniture and decorations were so dated. There were cracks in the wall, scratches and stains on the furniture and the ceilings were low making the room feel dark and small.The biggest issue was the bed. It was apparently one of those foam type mattresses and my husband, (who has a back issue), was not able to get any sleep. We were never told that the hotel used those types of mattresses and we definitely would have stayed somewhere else had we known.Breakfast appeared to be fine, however, we didn't have any because my husband was to tired to get up in time.The location, the staff and the services make this hotel a great place to stay if you are doing something in the Buckhead area, I would absolutely want to stay again. I just don't think my husband would agree.\n",

Call never came and when we got to the lobby at 3:30 there was a 1/2 hour line with one receptionist to get our room and keys. Receptionist said the other person must have forgotten. No \"sorry\" or other apology. The bedding was nice. The room smelled musty and would not clear with the A/C on high. The chain on the heavy blind was broken and the blind could not be raised so the room was very dark. We put in a maintenance request and when we returned to the room the shade was fixed but the door was left open. OPEN. we called the manager who said sorry and they would talk to maintenance. No other response. Breakfast look decent but did not eat it. Shuttle was a nice perk and location works for us. Might stay again but would look harder at nearby properties.\n",

My only complaint is when i went to take a shower there was hair on the shower walls. Wasn’t ours by far so I know the shower wasn’t cleaned ( it was on 2 different walls). If the shower wasn’t properly cleaned, what else wasn’t? We paid $398 for 2 nights. I expected at least a clean room. Other than that, everything was perfect. Beds were very comfortable.

      "  Review : I pre-purchased the room through a 3rd-party booking site. My 80-year old mother and I arrived at 1 a.m. after a long drive from Florida. Upon walking into our 4th-floor room we discovered extreme water damaged. The laminate flooring had become warped and damaged, swelling and cracking open in places; the door of the bathroom was so warped it would not close and the room reeked of mildew. Called down to the front desk explaining there was an issue with mildew and we could not stay in the room. The night manager told me to \"turn on the air conditioner for ten minutes and the smell would go away\". The air conditioner was running full blast at 68 degrees when we arrived and the only thing that is going to get rid of the damage to that room is a complete gut job. Went downstairs to speak with the manager in person. He sent another gentleman to come up and inspect the room. The second gentleman reviewed the room and apologized for the condition, saying \"Housekeeping\" should have informed them the room was in disrepair (yeah, right). After calling downstairs, he informed us the hotel was fully booked and they would send us to another hotel just down the block. Apparently, this is a common occurrence because they have a name for it called a \"walk through\". So, at 2:30 a.m. we were escorted down the street, past a dental office to the new hotel. Never should have happened - they knew the room was inhabitable, but wasted an hour and a half of our time in the middle of the night to flutter about. To add insult to injury, the guest services manager, who was not at the hotel that night refused to reimburse me as her employees had promised.\n",

Our room was clean, spacious, and comfortable. I especially liked the laminate hardwood floors. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet. The bed was placed very close to the air conditioner to the point where one side always felt damp. Fortunately it was a king bed and my wife could slide to the middle. Also, the air conditioner was leaking. I notified the desk as soon as we checked in and they had a guy lay down some towels with a promise to fix it, but when we checked out 5 days later it still hadn't been touched. One night the block lost power for several hours due to a suicidal squirrel, and the staff was fantastic! They kept their sense of humor, offered drinks, and made a very hot, dark situation tolerable. The free shuttle service (in a beautiful Mercedes shuttle bus!) was a nice touch. Breakfast was good, and iced lemon water available all day. It was a nice stay.\n",

If you are there in the hot,humid summer months keep the A/C well into the 60 range or your room will feel hot most of the time. Breakfast was more than plentiful with eggs, waffles,sausage,bacon and a variety of other offerings. Location was good for us...close to downtown but with a residential feel. There are a few restaurants withing walking distance.\n",

      "  Review : I am usually too lazy to write reviews, but my confusion about the very good to excellent rating of this facility motivated me to write this one. A consistent theme throughout the reviews is that the hospitality is very good, and I agree. Also, the location is great if you are looking to stay in the Buckhead area. The facility, however, needs a lot of work!We booked two rooms for our large family, and we were assigned rooms 417 and 418 across from each other; 417 had a very musty smell from the beginning but cooled off fine while 418 smelled OK but was muggy and never cooled despite running the antiquated AC unit at 66 on high for hours! While reasonably spacious for rooms with two double beds, both rooms looked worn and need to be updated.As suggested in other reviews, the rooms were noisy; if it wasn't the AC unit making loud noise, we could hear our neighbors walking above, bumping a wall, or flushing a toilet.I am glad I was able to use Wyndham points so that my stay in two rooms cost a total of $77 before taxes. I would have been very upset spending much more than this! \n",

Wouldn’t dream of staying anywhere else if I was in town for a concert at Chastain. Seemed like many of the guests were staying because of concert. Staff is remarkable. Free breakfast was good. Pool is nice for a hotel this size. Cookies at the desk every afternoon! Only suggestion is that rooms seem somewhat dated—otherwise this would be a 5 Star.\n",

      "  Review : We've stayed at the Wyndham Galleria a number of times and like the welcome they always offer, the jazz playing in the lobby, the caring and friendly staff and the comfort of the rooms. The only downside is how difficult it is to get in and out of the parking lot and dealing with the Atlanta traffic. This trip we decided to choose the Buckhead location instead. Room 505 was our home and while it was a nice room, neither the wifi or the phone worked. I went down to the lobby to ask if we could get another room and was told the hotel was fully booked. I sat down to do some work online and while I was sitting there, someone walked in and asked how much a room would be for the night. He was told they had two rooms available. I went back upstairs and tried to call the manager on my cell phone. He was not available. I left a message. I never heard back from anyone at the hotel. This was the first night of a month long road trip. Their current promotion gives Wyndham Rewards members 1 free night for every 2 nights paid stay. We were planning to take full advantage of this promotion. Instead, we stayed at other hotels where the wifi and the phones work and the staff appreciates our presence.\n",

The rooms are clean. The staff is friendly and down to earth. The parking is easy. When compared to the prices of other hotels in the area, this is a winner. This hotel is not the St Regis or Ritz Carlton and neither are the prices. You are not bombarded with help from everyone. If you ask for help they will assist you.  \n",

      "  Review : I ALWAYS book at the Wingate By Wyndham Buckhead location for all of my Atlanta trips. I have stayed at this hotel several times. I am not sure if it is under new management but I had a poor, yet atypical, experience there during my last stay. Any time I am asked for hotel recommendations in Atlanta, I suggest this hotel, however during my last stay in March 2018, I had a very abysmal experience which began before I even arrived. This hotel boast that you are not charged during booking, however I was charged days before I arrive without any notice whatsoever that my card would be charged. I was told by the hotel to read the fine print on the Booking.com website which gave them the right to charge my card at any time. Then when I got there, I was placed in a double Queen room not a King room like I booked. I was told that the hotel was full. The staff there was friendly but unhelpful. They seem to have a drastic offensive attitude change whenever I presented a problem. I was told to call the manager at a certain time when I called at that time I was told he was not there and to call back again at another time. The manager did finally call me back and basically stated the same policies and information that the attendants and clerks had given. He offered no consolations or service recovery. I am not sure that I will not go back to this hotel again. I am considering that. I do however love the décor of the hotel. The breakfast is definitely the star attraction of this property. It did not disappoint on this visit either. I came with a first time guest who also enjoy the hotel for the most part other than the service issues. The room was clean and inviting. The beds were comfortable. I don't have anything bad to say about the property itself, but the poor customer service did dampen the visit. \n",

      "  Review : I stayed at Wingate in ATL, the Buckhead location, for 2 nights. The southern hospitality was completely off the charts. I've never met such a friendly staff at any hotel I've stayed. The staff greeted me each morning and every time they saw me. The location is great. Lennox Mall is about 1.5 miles away along with great restaurants. Panera Bread is within walking distance and there are other places to eat not far away. The hotel also has a list of places they will shuttle you for free and it includes the Lennox Mall and some great restaurants. The hotel was clean, quiet, and had the feel of a home. I cannot stop singing the praises of how nice and customer centric this hotel is. When I'm in Atlanta again I will definitely stay here again. \n",

Although these rules were told to us and we followed them, we did not get much sleep as the room next to us woke us up at 3 a.m and we had to call security as the woman was screaming and there were a lot of bangs on the walls and door that connected our rooms. The next morning the front desk said it happens all the time and did not apologize or anything. When I pay for a nice room I expect to get sleep and if something was wrong with the stay I would appreciate an apology or something.\n",

The breakfast buffet is served on real plates not throw away. They even had someone making omlettes. The lobby is beautiful and bright. Homemade cookies are served every afternoon. Another perk is a free service so you don’t have to drive within a 2 to 3 mile radius.. Thinking it was a car service what a nice surprise when a luxury party limo bus pulled up . The driver each night was really nice . We never had to wait more then a few min each time. Our room was clean and the quite large. The shower was the best ever . We would definitely stay there again. \n",

      "  Review : The cynic and overly critical traveller in me feels so cheated to have to say this, but this really is a great, comfortable, convenient hotel for business travellers - restaurants nearby, a convenient shuttle, and a very clean room. However, the really standout feature here is without a doubt the staff - the front desk/reception staff are among the best I have ever seen on either side of the Atlantic: courteous, prompt, not easily rattled and always eager to go far beyond the normal standard of service one finds even in five-stars. The shuttle driver was also extremely cordial in that \"Southern way\" (like an old friend you were seeing again for the first time). In my brief stay, I was already of the opinion that this hotel was great value for money and perfect for weary business travellers, but an incident happened that made them shine even brighter. In the crack-of-dawn rush to the airport, I left a pair of boots in my room. They were new and pretty cute (if I do say so myself) so I was naturally concerned that they could have been \"misappropriated\" by housekeeping (common practice in many hotels). Not only were my boots found and submitted to lost & found (honest staff are no guarantee these days), but, even better - they actually kept the shoes safely at the front desk until my family could retrieve them. So now, I still have my boots and also know of at least one great hotel to stay in Atlanta.\n",

From Marquis and Monique at the front desk, to Charles who cooked our breakfast omelette and scrambled eggs, the staff was friendly and professional. Monique, in particular, was a stand out. The shuttle service was helpful, but the location is such that we walked to Peachtree Presbyterian Church, several good restaurants, our salon appointment, and the mall on Lenox Street. The double bed was very comfortable. I like the hardwood floors in the room, too. The room and bathroom were clean; however, some of the furniture and bathroom wall/door are showing signs of wear and tear. I should have mentioned it to the front desk upon checkout.\n",

      "  Review : My sister and I stayed here while visiting her daughter who lives in Atlanta. I always make the hotel arrangements. My sister always worries until we get there. She was impressed. I got a good deal on the room booking it through a service that I use regularly. We were greeted by 3 Hotel Reps who introduced themselves and said that they would be able to help us at anytime. After getting our room car and parking instructions which was free (don't take free parking in Atlanta as a normal option) we went up to our room. It was on the top floor. I love that but my sister was a little apprehensive. She usually travels with dogs. Well as I said, she was pleasantly surprised with the room. No it wasn't the Ritz but it was really nice and clean. A very fresh smell and larger than most rooms. It has a mini kitchen with a small fridge, stove top microwave and sink with utensils. It's one room separated by a half wall. We had 2 queen beds and on the other side was a comfy couch with TV. The TV was where you could watch it from the living area or the bed room. The bathroom was also clean. The sink area was separate from the toilet and shower/tub. We only had them clean the room once but it looked it did the first day. Downstairs in the lobby they had free breakfast and coffee. Breakfast was alright. Like the normal free breakfast. In the evening you could purchase libations of your choice. Even mixed drinks. They try to keep it warm but it never is. I usually had cereal. The coffee was great. Not cheap stuff. Most of the guest were business or part of a cheer squad. The hotel was located in Buckhead and was very easy to find but once we parked the car my niece did the rest of the driving until we left. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Well worth the price.\n",

It was obvious that the staff was not interested in assisting with anything unless it was absolutely necessary. I arrived 30 minutes before check-in time at 3 pm. I was turned away and told that there was no way I could check-in before the scheduled time. Once they were ready to me in, the main topic of conversation was all the rules and regulations. My key card was shut off promptly at 11 am, which caused me to get locked out of the hotel. I ended up having to leave the door to my room open in order to finish loading up the car. Less than two minutes later, I walk into my room and discover a maid putting all my belongings in a trash bag! None of it is that big of a deal. I retrieved my items from the trash and all will be okay. It just made me think that this hotel is different since I had never experienced any of these things at any other hotel. \n",

      "  Review : I decided to take a trip to Atlanta for New Years 2017 and did a lot of research to find a hotel within the downtown/midtown district that was affordable for a family and offered complimentary breakfast. I browsed Groupon to see what they had to offer and with much surprise this hotel appeared, it seemed to fit everything I was looking for so I took a chance and went for it! I was very pleased with the hotel staff, they were friendly, kind and willing to lend a hand. Their food was excellent, breakfast had a nice selection including an omelet station plus offered a dinner menu for late nights. \n",

      "  Review : Was very excited to stay here based on the reviews and price for the hotel. Staff was very nice that was the plus side. The room we were in was on the second floor near the main entrance and across from the elevator, avoid these rooms if you want to get some sleep. First off light was seeping through the window and we even tried to squeeze the blinds to stop the light but to no avail. Second the noise level from the consistent elevator banter and guests who were inconsiderate to other guests made this hard to sleep. The breakfast was not good, for one there was not enough and scraps were left over , plus the gentleman making the omelette looked like he would have rather not being there . Also a dress code at breakfast for guests might be a good suggestion as a pink robe with bunny ears and nothing else was inappropriate for my family. Being a Wyndham member I will avoid another stay at this location and opt for another hotel in Buckhead.\n",

Room was good though though you can hear road noise but it wasn’t bad enough to keep me from sleeping. The noise from the heater/AC was a bit loud though. Good location, only a few minutes from Lenox Mall and Phipps Plaza. Decent room rate especially with AAA discount. One thing to note there are three different suite types listed on their website. 2 of them are the same price but the pictures show one of them has doors separating the bedroom area from the seating area. I booked the one with doors but upon arrival I was told that room type costs more and the only difference between the rooms is the doors and the tub fits 2 people\n",

Really, you won’t find better service. The hotel in general is nice but kind of no frills, which is ok if you don’t need tons of amenities and high-end finishes. The room was clean but badly dated and kind of run-down feeling. I honestly wouldn’t have minded staying here even with these things taken into account if I hadn’t been charged what I was charged for the room. The lobby area and grounds of the hotel are nice, but the rates should absolutely reflect the state of the room. Yes, I would stay here again but NOT for the rate that we were charged for our night. \n",

      "  Review : Unfortunately, the hotel said that there was only one room down on the reservation. I booked for my wife, daughter, and father in law. Needed two rooms and that is what was booked. Wife showed the confirmation email and shared her name but they said only one room (under her name). They ended up having to all stay together.... not ideal in the least. I called the hotel in the AM to try to sort it out. The hotel said they had it under my father in laws name. I told them that yes, he was listed as another guest as that is what Booking asked for (since i was not the one staying). All under on purchase and one confirmation. The hotel said they would get with the GM and let me know how they will handle. Did not hear back and was charged the full price (not including the taxes) for the room.I am generally pretty easy and do not push it if I am unable to make a trip and get charged for a room I do not cancel. In this instance, they checked into the hotel but the other room was not located. Not sure why they did not have the reservation tied together as that was how it was booked through Booking. com and how the confirmation and trip were shown.Still trying to work out with Booking.com since hotel would not work with us.\n",

Marquis at the front desk made the trip and stay very enjoyable. He was very personable, professional and extremely helpful.

      "  Review : This hotel was very nice and the customer service was great! We were upgraded to a grand suite and it was wonderful. However, a couple of things that would have made it better... The rooms need updating: moldy bathroom tiles, rusted towel rack and stained floor tiles. Bath robes for the suites and bigger bath towels would have been a plus. We had problems with the WIFI in the beginning and our room didn't get serviced the on the day after check in. The breakfast was awesome and the capp/latte machine was a bonus! REAL oj would have been expected. The shuttle to the mall was super and i am so sorry i had no change for a proper tip (didn't expect to be taking it). The fact that no alcohol was served in the bar on Sunday was a downer and also that the hot tub had so much chlorine that it actually turned my bathing suit from black to gray. Thank you to the lovely agent/bar tender who cleared the leaves for me though. All in all it was a lovely stay and i wish i could have spent more time in the room... the bed was comfy! Price a little high due to the above quarks.\n",

      "  Review : We stayed there from 11/11-11/13. Let me start this off by saying I use to work for the Wyndham Timeshare. The lobby is breathing takingly beautiful! It was really late at night around 3am. The gentleman was great. We walked into our room and was greeted with hard wood floor and spacious. I am shocked at how well this room looks. We have stayed in hotel rooms before and it looked nothing like this. The bed was amazing and we melted into it. Everything was CLEAN! Not a single thing I could find that wasn't clean or stained at all. We have been to the travel Lodge in Orlando and it was completely gross. And not spacious at all. Everyday we had at least one freak towel set and adminities in a bag outside our door. This was a perk for us too! The staff members was AMAZING! They always has smiles on their faces and used the 10-5 rule at all times. We was waiting in the lobby one time and Mrs. Monique(I am so sorry if I misspelled that :() greeted us instantly! Chris who usually works second shift is great! We talked a little bit and we got a couple of snacks from him too. Once again all smiles. And Chef Charles is amazing! We are use to maybe a waffle for breakfast or cereal but not a lot breakfast like this! The omelettes was amazing and so was the food. Chef Charles was very sweet to us and after we left wished us safe travels back home. I've never been to a hotel like this. It made me feel like I was saying in know if the timeshare condos. And never had a room that was this clean. Even in the condo! Thanks to everyone who made this weekend for it. It was a very quick trip for my friend's wedding but it left an everlasting impression. The others have some competition to live up to now lol!Sincerely,Desirae G.\n",

She took care of me when I arrived too early for check-in and made sure I was not late to return to the airport. I swam, soaked and worked out everyday thanks to the amenities. I have recommended this as a great place to stay to all in Boston. Thank you so much and give that gal a raise! P.S. The great breakfast everyday was divine.\n",

      "  Review : Stayed here for one night and wasn't particularly impressed but it served its purpose.The Good:The area it's located in felt safe to me, and it was quiet. The staff was nice, the room was a good size, the water pressure was great, and everything seemed to be in working order. The mattress was a little on the firm side but it didn't make my back hurt so that was nice. The breakfast was good, the bath products were very nice, and the air conditioning worked great. Also, it was nice there was a refrigerator and a microwave in the room. The free parking was also nice.The Bad:I do have a few complaints, but it's just a few things that annoyed me, nothing that would ruin my stay or anything. The hotel is just a little worn down. Everything seemed to be in relatively good shape, it's just well-used. The entrance and load/unload zone is very awkward, and the parking seemed pretty limited, especially the handicapped parking. I was pretty annoyed that they wouldn't let me check in without a room being available. Most hotels that I have been to let you check in (and will even store your luggage) and then they call you when your room is ready and you can come get your key and pick up your luggage. Not this one, I was told that was not possible and to come back later. Also, they ran out of pancakes at 8am so if you want pancakes you better get there early. The weird:The rooms didn't have carpet (they had fake hardwood with area rugs), which I found very unusual. Also there was a nightstand on only one side of the bed. Neither of these things a good or bad, just not what I was expecting.Conclusion:I probably would consider staying here again but if there was a good deal somewhere else I would go with that. For what this hotel costs I expected something nicer.\n",

The room was clean and felt like home with a rug. some may have felt uncomfortable with chances for cross contamination but I felt comfortable. The spread for breakfast was pretty decent except they did not have meat options for those who do not eat pork. The oatmeal and grits with the topping options were amazing! Yet, the eggs and potatoes were cold. I am not sure if the burners were out or not. Therefore, for our two day stay, we only ate breakfast once. Oh and there was a stintch by the elevators, it was taken care of when oil was burned but when it wasnt...it was a bit much. The shuttle is very nice on the inside. My sister thought it was a party bus lol. But with all of that I would definitely return.\n",

In fact, the whole hotel, from the elevators to the hallways had that feel. There must be some issue with their HVAC system. Even with the AC on full blast, there was little help, and just gave us all colds. Just on account of that, this hotel can't be recommended. The good: the staff were friendly and the free breakfast was above average (although the weekday omelette maker is much too slow - please have eggs on the buffet too, like the weekend days). Neighborhood was nice with a number of restaurants and shops within 20 min walk.\n",

While I was checking in my daughter came in and told me I had to move my car, the big van guy said so. I told the front desk associate that I needed to unload my car and kids and he said I was fine. After I got my keys we grabbed a cart to put our bags on and as soon as I walked out the door the man who drove the shuttle demanded that I move my car. I told him when I arrived not even 5 minutes ago there was not room for me to park anywhere else to unload. He told me that I was blocking the shuttle vans parking spot and I had to move. I had my kids go stand by the door with the cart while i literally got into my car and moved it 5 feet out of the way. I then unloaded my car and sent my kids upstairs with the bags, this process took all of 5 minutes so I do not understand the rush with the shuttle parking. We stayed in room 505 the room was beautiful and I love the hard wood floors. My teenagers spent hours in front of the mirrors fixing their make up and hair. Great water pressure and hot water in the bathroom as well. The down side to room 505 was internet was too slow and barely worked. The ice maker on the 5th floor also didn't work. The beds were very comfortable and we all got a great nights sleep. Breakfast was good too with a wonderful selection. Myself and my kiddos liked the variety that was offered. I requested a late check out after breakfast and was denied that because others had requested it before me and they only allow so many. I asked if it mattered about being a rewards member and the benefits of being a platinum member was a late check out and was told they do not go by that. This hotel is very nice and we did enjoy it. Thanks to Marquise at the front desk, he was wonderful and kept my kids on their toes.\n",

      "  Review : We had plans to stay here while visiting Atlanta for my mother-in-law's birthday weekend. Our stay became an evacuation from our Florida beach home. I cannot say enough about the staff who made everyone welcome and helped with even minor requests. The breakfast was better then most and the wonderful lady in charge kept all the food replenished. Even when Irma brought tropical storm warnings we could enjoy a nice breakfast although some staff couldn't come in. There is even a latte/cappuccino machine:)The desk staff was wonderful!! We were always greeted and they asked how they could help. Our only glitch was a funky odor as we entered our room. Although they tried, this was never fully remedied. Our room was on the first floor next to the electrical room, so I suggest asking for a room upstairs.As the storm blew through Atlanta, we sat with several couples in the bar area enjoying a drink and some take-out Chinese ordered from a nearby restaurant that was miraculously open.The hotel is very conveniently located for shopping, dining, or exploring Atlanta. We will definitely return and greatly thank the staff for their warm southern hospitality \n",

If a light sleeper, maybe ask for a room on the back of the hotel as the street has a bit of traffic. 1.1 mile walk from MARTA buckhead station which brings you past restaurants, shopping and grocery stores. Is a safe walk during daylight. Would stay here again \n",

I was really impressed by this Wingate as I've stayed in several other Wingates in the past. This one is far superior compared to the others especially opposed to the Wingate in Norcross, which had that lazy dude working at nights who was usually sleeping when customers needed help. I really despise that guy.Anyways, this property is pretty nice, and there is also a shuttle service for folks who want to party in Buckhead. I recommend this place for all. Boom!\n",

      "  Review : Along with quite a few followers for the other team, we chose this Wingate to stay at for a very late leaving football game. It was close to MARTA, in as safe an area as possible, and we could use our points. We were able to check in a little early and the room was great, facing the road with the traffic noise barely noticeable. The ONLY blip was the bed is a little close to the A/C unit for the person on that side of the bed to walk around in the middle of the night, in the dark. Breakfast was very satisfying, with bacon, sausage, eggs, the whole works. Oh, and I want that latte/cappuccino/espresso machine for my home. \n",

      "  Review : I feel so very fortunate that serendipity had me plan this vacation and my first night's stay at the Wingate by Wyndham in Buckhead. I reside in Boca Raton, currently predicted a catastrophic zone for Hurricane Irma. I felt so fortunate that I didn't have to decide about evacuating that this vacation already made that decision for me. I was feeling so good I agreed to be a volunteer on my flight to have my bag checked at the gate because the plane was full with fleeing South Floridians. Well my bag didn't make it on the flight. No worries, they said it would arrive on a 2:30 flight and be dropped off at my hotel, but I went the whole night without it.But my fantastic hospitality was kicked off by Monique who directed me to the Walgreens two blocks away to get some allergy medicine why I waited for my bag to arrive. Then there was a shift change and Marie had already been made aware to expect my bag. She was extremely busy handling a non-stop ringing phone with professionalism and the patience of Job talking with panicked Floridians trying to find a room. I spent quite a bit of time talking with the bartender Jonathan for happy hour and dinner. When I was unable to sleep due to heartburn, KP and Marie were both helpful again and were sympathetic about my bag still not arriving and asking whether I preferred a wake up call if it arrived in the middle of the night. KpP lent me another sympathetic ear in the morning and encouraged me to wait for Ferris to shuttle me to the train station instead of walking for safety reasons. The breakfast was delicious and had an impressive offering. Then the delightful Ferris gave me safe passage to the train and advised me how to get picked up. I successfully retrieved my bag at the airport and returned the hotel to a smiling Monique who provide me with spa recommendations and laughter. Then F.M. cleaned around me as I sat in the lobby on my computer and offered me a funny antidote to brighten my day. Throughout my night, I became more panicked as I recalled my passport and birth certificate, and SS card were in my bag and could only get voice mail throughout the night to inquire about my bag, this wonderful family of hospitality personified professionals kept me calm, comfortable, and fed. I may not have a home to return to after this storm passes, but I know where I can go stay to feel like I am at home the next time I am in Buckhead. Thank you Monique, Marie, KP, Jonathan, Ferris, and F.M. for your outstanding and incredible hospitality, you are forever in my heart anf I am eternally grateful.\n",

      "  Review : This is an excellent hotel for both business and vacation, conveniently located in the popular Buckhead area of Atlanta. The staff is helpful and friendly. The room we stayed in (with two queen sized beds) was a good size for our family of two adults and two young children. The refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker enabled us to have food whenever the children wanted at a reasonable cost. For families, there is a very nice pool, and you are close to the excellent Chastain Park. The complimentary hot and cold breakfasts are excellent. I especially recommend the crispy bacon and the made-to-order omelets. And the all-day complimentary cappuccino/late maker increased my coffee consumption considerably. Other than the breakfasts, you have to get your food from outside. But there is a large selection of fast-food outlets and restaurants just minutes away - and the hotel provides a complimentary shuttle service if you don't want to drive to them, or you can order the food to be delivered to the hotel. All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and found it to be excellent value for money.\n",

It's centrally located and even has a shuttle that will take you to places within a 3 mile radius. The room was fantastic and more than I could have asked for, but the reason I'll continue to stay at this hotel when I visit Atlanta is because of the charm and hospitality of the employees. Marie, Marquis, and Monique went out of their way to answer any questions and continuously anticipated my needs during my nearly week long stay. I looked forward to one of them greeting me on my way out or when I returned. They took the time to ask about my day to ensure that I was enjoying my time in Georgia. It felt like coming home and I'm definitely looking forward to my next stay!\n",

      "  Review : Five star service at this local gem. Felt like family as the front desk staff greeted us by name when we passed by throughout the day. The room was comfortable and it is nice to have a parquet flooring instead of carpeting. Breakfast was fresh with lots of choices including eggs, waffles, potatoes, oatmeal, hot biscuits and muffins, and of course grits. Hint-add a little cheese and butter to make tasty cheese grits. On the weekdays there is a cute elderly gentleman making omelettes with an \"iron\". You have to watch him as he slowly crafts cook-to-order omelettes. Coffee machine is also a nice bonus. Parking is free, but a challenge on a crowded day. Thanks to Marie who really took care of our family. There is also a limo shuttle that we did not use, but is a nice bonus. Pool is also nice for a swim on a hot day in Atlanta. Internet is slow, but the business office down stairs works perfectly. We arrived late, tired and hungry, so we went to the Landmark Diner a block away where we felt like were transported to the 1950's. Good late night food with huge salads and fresh seafood. \n",

      "  Review : What a great find. The hotel has very clean rooms, a really friendly and helpful staff, a great free hot breakfast(they even make omelettes). The service is exceptional and the prices are really very fair considering what you get here. Of special note make sure you meet Monique(she's real sweet and at the front Desk), Theresa and Charles.\n",

      "  Review : The stay at Wingate was lovely. Everyone I came in contact with was charming. From the Receptionist to the driver, to getting my waffles and eggs done in the morning. No matter how late we left the room, we always came back to a clean room. The setting is so relaxing that one could be forgiven for thinking one is at home. We look forward to going back pretty soon.Well done guys and keep up the good work.\n",

      "  Review : After being on the road for a week it was a welcome relief to stay in a room that felt like home. My suite had a kitchenette, dining room table, living room, and bedroom with French doors. Loved that it had a hard wood floor with a large area rug instead of nasty carpeting. (My dust mite allergies thank you.) My room on the 5th floor had a few things that need repair. 1) The French doors stick terribly when you close them. 2) The bathroom door sticks as well (so badly that you can't pull it closed all the way.) All of these doors need to be sanded down or the hinge screws need to be tightened.The wifi is an absolute joke and does not work no matter what you do. Period. Both AC units are loud and the one in the bedroom is cooler than the one in the living room. Marquise at the front desk is an absolute doll! What fabulous customer service! Breakfast was good but the other reviewers were spot on with their assessment of the slow omelet lady. I didn't have time to wait for her so I just grabbed some scrambled eggs. The coffee here is gross. :/ All in all I would definitely stay here again. It's located really close to downtown Atlanta.\n",

      "  Review : So as far as the actual hotel room, it is decent and leans slightly towards the outdated side. The decor definitely needs a facelift and it doesn't have the modern, clean look that I'm used to seeing at other Wingates. However, where it is lacking in style, it exceeds in customer service. Marquise was such a pleasant face at the front desk. He was knowledgeable and friendly, and answered any and all of your questions. He suggests great places to see around Atlanta and always has a welcoming smile and greeting waiting for you when you come in and out of the hotel. He really makes you feel at home and his coworkers share the same warm etiquette.The amenities at the hotel are well kept. The pool looked nice, even though I didn't use it. Breakfast was amazing and had it's own personal chef to make you omelets. The Shuttle service was prompt and ran regularly. The Drivers were personable and knew the area well.Overall, my stay was excellent! Had the room been upgraded with modern decor, I would have NO complaints at all.\n",

      "  Review : Stayed here for a weekend and was pleasantly surprised. The lobby and room were clean and we checked in on arrival. The bedding and pillow were very comfortable altough the AC unit was noisy and the fan in the bathroom ran constantly. The room had a safe, mini-fridge coffee pot and microwave. Despite facing the street it was fairly quiet although I think a room facing the pool would be quieter. We did not use the exercise room and it's very basic. The biggest complain was with the breakfast. Only ate it one day (very salty eggs, bacon, sausage, oatmeal, hard-boiled eggs, pre-made mini waffles, canned fruit and home fries. Actually went out for breakfast the second AM to get some better food. Most people there seemed to like it but the price was right. It was really nice getting into this part of Atlanta with free parking.\n",

I ended up using my aircard just to get work done. The breakfast is ok if you have plenty of time to wait for an omelet or waffles, with a line it was almost 30 minutes to get my omelet ordered - they can only handle 1 person at a time. \n",

She makes an amazing omelette and waffles! The breakfast is very good! And last but not least Monique, she was very nice. Always had a smile and ready to help. We all felt at home and peaceful.

Check-in process was smooth and easy, parking was great and the suite lay out my boyfriend selected was nice. However, we noticed from checking out the room that they had ants round the HVAC system. My boyfriend woke up with bit marks all over his back and ankles the first night. (We did have a room facing the trees so that may have cause the ants to come in through the HVAC so I do suggest they spray often in the rooms facing the trees.) We went down to the front desk and the receptionist Marquis had housekeeping Ms T. come check for bed bugs and also gave us fresh sheets/pillow cases. We were very pleased with his professionalism and the other staff as well during our stay.We did enjoy the breakfast selection and free shuttle rides within 3miles.

The food is okay in the bar/lounge, and the breakfast is maybe slightly above average for this kind of place.My only point of disappointment is that even with the air conditioning on full blast the rooms are still humid and never get really cool. This is my second stay, two different rooms, and I've had the same issue in both.\n",

There was a free shuttle to and from the venue which meant I didn't have to worry about finding alternate transportation or trying to navigate a city I had never been in. The Driver, Craig, was extremely professional and prompt. The breakfast would rival any restaurant around and the room was very comfortable. There was a pool which was nice too. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Atlanta.\n",

      "  Review : The hotel, room and breakfast were great but the hotel had issues with fire alarm and power. On the first night we had a false fire alarm at six a.m. Everyone had to leave their rooms until it was determined to be a false alarm. It totally interrupted our sleep and day. On the second morning of our stay we woke up at six a.m. With no power and no air conditioning. It was extremely hot and we couldn't use restroom due to no light. Again, our sleep and day were totally interrupted by this power outage. Although, not the fault of the hotel, it was pretty much a ruined weekend. The hotel did not offer any compensation for the problems experienced. I would stay again and hopefully this was just an anomaly that wouldn't occur again.\n",

      "  Review : My husband and I stayed here this past weekend. I selected this property because it was pretty central to things we wanted to do and places we needed to go. The gentleman at the front desk who checked us in Friday night was very nice and had a great attitude. I think his name was Maurice or Marcus. The room was clean, but you could tell that it was an older hotel that had been renovated. They should think of expanding their parking. Saturday night we got back to the hotel around 1030pm and were told that the lot was full and we needed to park next door at a doctor's office. It seemed a little sketchy, but our vehicle was fine. Also, I asked when I checked in since we were paying with a debit card how long the hold would be. I was told 7-14 days which was fine, however I have been charged twice by them with 2 different amounts, the 2nd of which has caused my account to overdraft. It's still pending, so I'm not super worried right now (it still has the potential to drop off), but just beware that if you use a debit card you open yourself up to this possibility. Overall I would definitely stay here again. \n",

I was promised a discount rate (132.05) when making both my reservations. I received that rate for the first reservation but not the second. When I arrived for the second reservation my rate was (170.05). When I asked why my rate was changed, I was told that rates change every day. I did inform them that I was not told that my rate would change for the second reservation. They did state that they did give me the same discount that I was given before. My concern is that I was given 1 rate when both reservations were made and charged two different rates. This was unfair because this was not what I was told. \n",

      "  Review : I would love to comment the motel on how well managed this motel is. We had a wonderful experience for our first time at at Wingate by Wyndham. The staff were all so kind and friendly. We arrived somewhat after check-in time and were treated with fresh baked cookies at the front desk. Check-in was super quick and easy. Room we stayed in was excellent. It was roomy and very clean. Also, the room was cleaned, refreshed, and refurnished every morning. Breakfast every morning was superb. Made to order omelettes and waffles. Pretty much anything you could have wanted for a quick breakfast before heading out into the city was available. Wonderful coffee bar with many different choices on coffee such as types coffee/latte/cappuccinos. Limo service was available to take you to local places within a certain mile radius which was a wonderful asset to the motel. The drive to downtown was very easy from the motel to downtown attractions and only about 10 mins. Away depending on morning/afternoon traffic. The motel was also in a very nice and safe area and I was very pleased with it. If we return to Atlanta, I would definitely stay here again because it was such a wonderful experience. Highly recommend!\n",

      "  Review : Arrived at the hotel around 6pm and went to check in. The receptionist was so busy we where left waiting about 10 minutes. She was talking on two phones simultaneously dealing with someone trying to make a booking and the other phone was someone querying a bill. There was also a guy in front of us trying to check out but his credit card was declined so the poor receptionist was also trying to deal with that. In fairness she handled everything very professionally but maybe one extra staff member would help. We checked in to our room on the second floor and first impressions of the room where good. It was a good size room with a big comfortable bed and lots of floor space so we where happy. The hotel has a nice pool area which herself sat at for a few hours while I was out so that got the thumbs up. Free parking on site which was nice. The buckhead area is big so you will need a car if your planning on dining out. There is a Walgreens about 5 min walk away which we paid a visit to and because our room had a fridge it seemed rude not to buy a six pack ! All in all happy enough with the hotel maybe hire a few extra front desk staff and things would go a lot smoother. We would defiantly stay here again if we where in the area \n",

      "  Review : Stay at this location often. Sometimes we require an extra night as we did this time. Booked the room at 141.00. I requested an extra night with the desk clerk who confirmed she had availability. But because of the anticipated \"demand\" for rooms in the area, she increased our rate to 179.00 for the second night. We declined and checked out the following morning and booked a room in the area comparable in quality for 120.00. Disappointing.\n",

      "  Review : I use Wyndham Rewards for most of my travels. I've stayed in numerous Wingate motels and all have been fine but the one in Buckhead, GA is by far the best. The whole experience was very positive from the front desk staff, to the shuttle drivers to the room cleanliness and decor and the ample free parking. But the star of the show was the complimentary breakfast. The quality of the food was excellent and I have never previously experienced at a Wingate or any comparable motel/hotel a made from scratch omelet station. The next time I visit the Atlanta area I will definitely stay at the Wingate in Buckhead.\n",

The breakfast was fabulous (waffles and omelette station, latte coffee, crisp bacon) and the staff were very courteous and helpful. Even though we didn't have our rooms clean daily the maid left some toiletries and a set of towels for us. Lots of eating places close by and the commute to downtown took about 20 minutes. Highly recommend this chain of hotels.\n",

What Fox news has done to America is tragic and the fact that the owner is shoving that down the throat of the patrons isn't right.Also, there was a weird beeping noise in my room that prevented me from getting any sleep.\n",

The hotel is very clean, rooms are a decent size and beds very comfortable. The complimentary breakfast is good with freshly cooked omelettes and waffles to order which were superb. The free limo service within a 3 mile radius is a fantastic asset to the hotel. We used it to take us to the local shopping mall and also to the local MARTA train station which meant we didn't have to drive into the city centre. We just had to phone for pick up when we were ready. The hotel is in a nice location, felt very safe. Would highly recommend and wouldn't hesitate to return if we ever find ourselves in the area again. An excellent start to our Deep South road trip\n",

We were going to a birthday party at a restaurant that was 2.7 miles from the hotels but the limo driver refused to take us, he said it was out of his range; although the desk clerk was sure our destination was within the area. Since we waited for the limo and then was refused it caused us to be late to our surprise party that we had to drive ourselves. You would have definitely gave 5 stars if we didn't have this problem. \n",

The king bed was comfy. The pull out sofa a roll away were not super comfy but...my kids didn't seem to notice. The room was very clean. The jacuzzi tub in the room was awesome. I had never seen this type. I want one now. The hotel staff was among the friendliest I have ever seen. The made to order omelets at breakfast were great. I also had sausage and toast and biscuits and gravy. All of it was fabulous. The biscuits were amazingly good and soft. We used the shuttle once and my kids loved it...a Mercedes limo shuttle. They felt like royalty. The pool and hot tub was nice...peaceful too. We would certainly recommend this place again. \n",

      "  Review : I believe my experience was atypical of this property, but I still need to warn other guests. I will never stay here again.In the hotel's defense, the particular weekend I stayed the hotel was possibly overbooked, however, I was there for three nights leading up to my wedding day. I checked in late on Wednesday and asked for a quiet room, however, the only king bed room they had available (supposedly) was on the 2nd floor right above the dining room and lobby area. They said to come back the following night to check if they had further availability, which wasn't worth the trouble at the time. Fast forward all the wedding festivities which kept me busy every waking moment to Saturday morning, the day of my wedding and the check-out day. Finally, can get some rest...wrong.People are up making noise in the lobby until 2-3am with no courtesy of other guests, affecting those staying in the open walled rooms on the 2nd floor. Front desk staff didn't do anything about it, and the noise continues early in the morning with the clanging of plates and silverware from the dining room. Now, I am usually a heavy sleeper but the nerves of my wedding day, accompanied with the lobby noise, I may have gotten 2-3 hours of sleep. At 8AM I had to leave the hotel to take my mom to get her hair and makeup done, and didn't want to have to take all zillion bags I had with me, particularly my tuxedo as I would've preferred to change into that at the hotel. So I went to the front desk to ask for a late checkout of 2PM hoping to get back by noon for a nap. I have traveled for work over 100 hotel nights a year for the past 5 years and have never had such a rude response to such a simple question. I tried to recall what heinous act I had done over the past 72 hours to garner such a response. I couldn't. The hotel just had it out for me. Told them it was my wedding day, there was still no remorse.I agreed to pay the $65 fee for an extra 2 hours. Now, I couldn't fall asleep because of how much I regretted staying at this hotel, or at least fought tooth and nail to get a new room the first night. When someone says, nothing is available I would th\n",

The breakfast was the best breakfast I have ever had at a hotel. The staff was so nice and well mannered. The young man in the evening saw I was having trouble parking and he came out and offered to park for me. Words cannot express my gratitude of how the staff treated my family and I.

Especially loved the FULL HOT BREAKFAST, actually have someone to cook your gourmet omelet and waffles for you. The only thing that bothered me is it was always warm in the hallways and our room seems not cool enough, but I'm hot natured. Also, I wished the mini-fridge had a freezer compartment for our ice packs. We traveled with a baby. Just small things, but other than that...GREAT PLACE & SERVICE!!!\n",

I had to call several times ahead of our visit with questions about the property, and the front desk was always answered with kindness. Breakfast is AMAZING (way beyond your typical \"free breakfast\"...a very nice chef makes omelets to order!), and the bar was quiet and well-stocked with good wine. I did have a small issue with the wi-fi, but when I reported it, the amazing front desk clerk got tech support on the phone immediately and the issue was resolved in less than 10 minutes.

The staff are very friendly and super nice!!! The guest rooms are nice but I have to rearrange some of the chairs in the room because there are too many and one is right in the walkway. If you don't want a pillow that goes flat as soon as you lay on it then take your own. I don't know why all the hotels are going to the instant flat and small pillows but I now just travel with my own. They are in the process of remodeling so hopefully they will also declutter the rooms! \n",

All service personnel were friendly and helpful.Below, you will note that I rated room cleanliness unacceptable. My wife and I stayed 3 nights, The room met our expectations upon arrival, but was not made up either of the two following days. ON the 2nd day, we returned to the room about 3:30; the towels had been removed from the room, but no other attention paid to the room. We called and were told were were \"on the schedule'. Ultimately, after 4:30, the room was finished. We considered the timing of the service totally unacceptable. Also, you posted cards in bathroom to re-use our towels. We hung up our towels and the bath mat both days, but your staff replaced the towels anyway. Why ask that we reuse the towels when you are going to wash them anyway? By the way, most hotels do the samething you do - very frustrating to me.\n",

      "  Review : Check-in was swift. The staff were all exceptional--so friendly and always eager to help, during every shift. Our room was large and had all beautiful wood (well, laminate) floors--excellent for allergy sufferers! All hotels should ditch the carpeting like this smart hotel! The bed was comfortable and had all non-feather pillows--great for allergy sufferers! The sheets were so soft. There were power outlets near each side of the bed--great for charging phones and devices at bedside. The room had a safe, mini-fridge, microwave, and coffeemaker.The bathroom had a shower/tub combo with scarcely any mold--good job, housekeeping! The shower head looked old and clunky, but once turning on the water, wow, it was amazing! The water pressure was outstanding, and the hot water stayed hot. There were plenty of towels, which is always a nice touch. Unfortunately, the bathroom had a noisy fan that did nothing to eliminate steam; it just served as annoying noise pollution, and should be on a separate switch. The Kleenex was soft--thank you!The free WiFi (unsecured--NOT smart) was troublesome, dropping in and out--so frustrating when you need to work!!! In this electronic age, stable WiFi is vital. The hotel has a free, open-air parking lot. There are a number of restaurants within walking distance, plus, the hotel shuttle provides transportation within three miles--nice perk.If they can fix their WiFi issues, I'd gladly stay here again if I'm in the area.\n",

The check in was very fast and the receptionist was very mannerable and informative. Marquis was FANTASTIC!!!! He definitely is the best person to have at the front desk!!! His attitude makes the hotel environment very warm and inviting. The rooms are very spacious and clean and the clean up staff is on point with the cleaning service. The breakfast was amazing!!! The cook (Liz) is awesome as well. She brings a warm spirit to the breakfast lounge while making fantastic omelets. The manager of this hotel couldn't have hired a better staff. They work together very well and made our hotel visit a memorable experience. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.\n",

When we asked the front desk about it, they offered to change rooms, but they said that there is nothing they can do about getting rid of the sound produced by the old piping and A/C systems. By the way, the breakfast was very good.\n",

Free parking.Nice common area with a small but well stocked and reasonably priced bar that stays open till 11 pm. Pull and a hot tub. Small gym. Business center with a few printers.Breakfast with made-to-order omelets and waffles. Coffee 24/7. We stayed in a suite. It's twice the size of a regular room. Fridge, microwave, pull-out couch. Air-conditioner (2 in a suite) were old and quite noisy. The TV in the living room was to far from the bed for our middle aged eyes. Furniture is starting to show its age. Bed was comfortable with good pillow and blankets. Large bathroom with a shower and a jacuzzi tub. Plenty of towels and toiletries. Our room faced the street. The traffic noise was quite prominent.The staff is very friendly and attentive. They provide shuttle service to/from the Lenox mall and other surrounding businesses.\n",

The iron had gunk on it and it was replaced at my request. The soap ledge in the shower was dirty. The A/C never cutoff, as the fan ran all night. Management needs to go through the rooms and look at the details from time to time. And please for goodness sake do reply with a form response. That is very in genuine. \n",

The workers at the front desk were very pleasant, friendly and very helpful when we were looking for places to go and things to do they made us feel really comfortable! Good friendly service, very clean up to date hotel, the room was nice and clean, everything was great! Excellent area it's close to both malls, the MLK national historical site, CNN, and the Coca-Cola company. Breakfast was great omelet done the way you want it. It was a comfortable stay!!! There is also a shuttle bus that takes you where you want to go and will pick you up when you are ready! Can't beat it for the price you pay!!! We plan on going back soon with our family and friends!!! A MUST STAY PLACE!!! EXCELLENT !!!\n",

The rooms are great. The breakfast provided is always great and with variety. The shuttle bus provided to the area is a perfect topper to this location. You don't have to fight with the traffic. You can let someone else do that for you. Markese at the front desk is absolutely the most inviting person to deal with. He always greats you with a smile and speaks to you by name every time he sees you. Love going back to this location.\n",

I'm extremely OCD and the first thing I do is look at the entrance. It was extremely clean. So I went in and the lobby was so clean you could eat off the floor. Check in was a little strained because we arrived late, so she couldn't locate my reservation and the computer was down. But within seconds it was located and my room key was in my hand. They had already checked us in. We got up to the room and I did my usial inspection. I couldn't find one speck of dirt. Everytime I left it was have a pleasant evening or day, everytime I came back it was I hope you got to see the sites or did you have fun. I absolutely loved this hotel and the staff.

When reading the amenities i was like ok cool it all sounds good but i only ate the breakfast potatoes (which were great) but i can say when the website says southern style breakfast they mean it, grits eggs bacon sausage fruit salad potates etc... I send kudos out to night front desk being so patient upon arrival in at after 2am delayed from the storms up north.

      "  Review : We enjoyed our recent stay at this property. All customer service aspects were top notch. The only thing I would note is that unless you are staying at this property for business/conference reasons (i.e. \"block\" rate, etc.) you are going to spend some time in local traffic to see most \"tourist\" sites around Atlanta, many of which are in downtown land east Atlanta. In other words, due to the location, north of midtown and downtown, you're either going to deal with normal congestion on interstates or you are going to deal with the \"residential\" routing to bypass (which is very slow), with many turns expected.\n",

The sink would not drain, the desk chair was so old and worn that I could feel the bolts through the remaining padding, the desk lamp was broken, the coffee maker did not work, and the in-room climate unit was old and noisy. Nothing fatal, but it was a lot of negatives for one stay. .None of these are the kind of thing that would make me run to the front desk or call for a new room, so I figured I would keep the concerns to myself unless they asked how my stay was at check-out.

I booked it online using my reward points. The night I arrived and called for shuttle I was told the shuttle is done for the night. I could kind of under stand that part. I called at 1030 pm that night. I hired a cab for $65 dollars to take me over 25 minutes to this motel. I followed are drive on my phone GPS and the cab driver was correct. The next morning I got up and then was told the shuttle is only free for a 3 mile radius. At least I got a free ride to the subway train where I had to pay another $6 dollars for a couple tickets to the airport. The break feast that was served the next morn was less than impressive. At least it was free except for the tip I don't mind paying. Save the money and stay in a Super 8 out by the airport.\n",

The staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was beautiful and most of all very clean! The breakfast was amazing with lots of choices from the southern grits to a chef to make your own personal omelette. The area was quite and most of all I felt very safe, the parking lot had great lighting and the area was very open . The Lenox mall was just a few miles down the road. I highly recommend staying at Wingate. The price is under the quotes I had gotten from other hotels downtown. I believe we could not have gotten a better stay even if I had paid $200 more dollars for it. Great hotel will definitely stay again! Highly recommend!\n",

At the counter the Wingate associate, Bre'shay welcomed us and stated that there was coffee available. That was a relief in that we had just driven from Clearwater.The rooms at Wingate are always nice.The next morning the associate Veronica assisted us with how to get back onto I-75 with ease and was very pleasant as well.\n",

      "  Review : The Buckhead Wingate is a great travel hotel. Quick, Clean, efficient, and well located. What sets this hotel apart is the staff. We had a complicated reservation and it was handled with ease.When I realized I had left the copies of my folio behind I called, was greeted by Marquis and told him I needed copies. He asked if I could be placed on hold, which was no issue. When he returned less that 30 seconds later the emailed copies were already in my inbox. He never even asked my name. He looked at the caller ID, located my records, and just sent them directly over. AMAZING SERVICE. He's a credit to the hotel. I will be back in a couple weeks and they have earned my repeat business.\n",

The room wood floors, instead of carpet, created a cleaner and pleasant environment-loved it! The bath towels were thick and soft and the shower water flow was good. Breakfast was excellent, with a great deal of variety, and all seemed fresh. A server made a delicious omelet and waffles for us. The outside pool and hot tub looked super clean and inviting. The location of the hotel was excellent as well, near malls, restaurants, and major roads. The staff was genuinely friendly. A couple of minor issues: the bathroom ceiling was peeling at a corner and the material inside the duvet rolled up into a ball overnight--we hope management works to keep up all aspects of the hotel in excellent condition. It's a great find and we plan to stay there whenever we go to Atlanta in the future.\n",

I was able to drown some of it out with the heater/cooling fan. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful. My biggest complaint is that my room had no internet or cell phone signal. I moved to a different room for the 3rd night, this had better internet, but the cell service was spotty, in and out (I have a well known national provider). So if you do not need to work in the hotel while staying here I would recommend it.\n",

      "  Review : We stayed here for four nights back in July of 2016. The first couple of nights, we were in a room facing the street. At night, or at anytime really, you would hear the sirens of emergency vehicles as if they were blasting directly through your window. It was so freakin' loud that it woke up my son multiple times each night. Tip: get a room that does not face the street, especially if you like sleeping through the night. That being said, on the morning of the third night, I went to front desk and politely asked if there was anyway we could get a room facing away from the street. The woman at the front desk, (I wish I remembered her name because I truly want to give her props for this) was so, so, nice. She was like, \"Yeahhhhh, sureeeee, y'all can go right now!\" As in, she immediately found a room for us to switch to and we switched that instant. My kid, husband, and I were finally able to sleep through the night on the third night and the fourth as well. One of the nights, they had some crazy college kids partying by the pool. They weren't too loud, it didn't wake my kid up anyway, but they were so wasted and they broke the door that was the entrance to the pool! So, if you saw a broken pool door, that is why. The breakfast was good. The pool was nice, we used it everyday. The area of Buckhead is nice, too. It is about a 15 min drive to the aquarium and Coke museum. Oh, and the cookies at the front desk are pretty great too. I wouldn't stay here again, simply because I am not going to go to Atlanta again. Crossed that off my bucket list, on to different cities. But if you're teetering between this and another hotel, I'd give this one a shot.\n",

Secondly, the staff is absolutely lovely each and every time. Third, for the location and value it is a no brainer. With parking and breakfast included, you can't beat the price. It's easy to get downtown or where ever you may be headed. There are lots of food choices and shopping nearby in case you need anything last minute. We will be back!\n",

First and foremost, the entire staff is top-notch ... the friendliest and most helpful staff we have ever experienced. The Delux king room was the best Wingate room we've ever had. Having a custom-cooked breakfast was a terrific benefit, along with a dinner menu, local shuttle service and a bar. Hats off to the owner of this Wingate and his entire staff. We will always return to this Wingate when visiting the Atlanta area.\n",

      "  Review : My best friend and I did a short weekend trip here and we were so pleasantly surprised by this little gem of a hotel. The front desk receptionists Monique and Marie were both amazing. They were very pleasant and eager to help make our trip memorable. The breakfast buffet was nice with an omelette station but my hats off to their commercial grade espresso maker that was available to the guests around the clock. I did not have to hunt down a coffee shop once with this machine at the hotel lobby. If we were to be in the area again, I would definitely stay at this hotel again!!\n",

Best of all was the Host for breakfast the next morning. \"Sly\" was so nice he kept us all happy and was so much a \"southern gentleman\" in making us feel so welcome. Thanks for a great night and we will see you on the return trip. \n",

The air conditiioners (two) were blowing but weren't cooling the room to the thermostat setting. I turned them off and opened the windows to let (cooler) fresh air in, which helped. However, when I closed the windows one of them did not close properly and allowed a strong (and noisy) infiltration of air from outside. The wifi was weak or nonexistent signal-wise, making me think the fifth floor room was on the outer range of the wireless router. A fan in the bathroom ran constantly (and noisily) and there was no switch to turn it off. \n",

We had requested a baby crib when making the reservation, however there wasn't one in the room when we got there.We booked this suite for $200, and it was not really what we expected at that rate.The pillows in the bed were the size of sofa cushions and very uncomfortable. The sheet looked all wrinkly when we took at the covers off.The hotel building is definitely showing age and I would not pay $200 for another Wyndham hotel again.Positives were location, and free breakfast and friendly front desk staff.Negatives were uncomfortable pillows, room not made up, old building, no indoor pool.\n",

      "  Review : The room looked nice. My two problems deal with sanitation. 1) Thursday morning, I ordered an omelet for breakfast. I did not notice this until after I sat down to eat. I noticed the gentleman as he prepared an omelet for another person, flipped the omelet with a spatula AND his fingers. It was then I noticed he was not wearing gloves. After that, he reached in barehanded for cheese and sprinkled it on the omelet. On Friday, the lady who made omelets wore latex gloves. 2) The shower head needed to be cleaned. I did not notice it until Friday morning when I took my shower before I checked out. I took a picture and showed it to the young lady when I checked out. I told her housekeeping need to spray some cleaner on it and scrubbed the build up off. She agreed that it was filthy and needed to be cleaned. She said she would inform housekeeping. If she did, then the problem is resolved. On my end, I need to be more observant before hand. Depending on the time of day, the traffic buildup is major. It took nearly a hour to drive 8 miles to go downtown.\n",

We'll Friday morning I did my usual routing but the guy at the front desk said I had to wait which it didn't start till 6 am anyway bUT why had been eating a little early every morning and the food is just warm not hot so why not eat early. So since the breakfast is included in the price of the hotel and it does state that I will no longer stay at that hotel by no means and if you have to leave by 6 don't plan on any breakfast or atleast get them to lower the price of the room. \n",

      "  Review : This is a classy hotel with spacious rooms in a pleasant and safe leafy area. There is a free shuttle service to the station which is only about a mile away and the nearest resturants are nearer than that. We particularly liked the fact that hot and cold drinks were available in the reception area and the breakfast was a particular highlight as omelettes are cooked to order on the spot. If we go to Atlanta again, it would certainly be to this hotel.\n",

The room was very nice and clean, with really lovely decor. Marquis, the young man at the desk, was helpful, friendly and welcoming. We loved Marquis and his charming demeanor. We highly recommend the shuttle to and from the hotel to the shopping area. It's luxurious and very easy. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay. \n",

My husband and I stayed here for a mini-anniversary weekend, and the service and facilities were excellent! Clean rooms, clean pool area (which we had almost completely to ourselves - yay!), great service, super friendly and helpful staff. The location in Buckhead is perfect - the hotel shuttle will drop you off 3 miles from the hotel - and if you'd like to go farther, Uber and taxis are easy to get. The Landmark Diner is just a stones throw from the front door, and the Big Ketch seafood restaurant is an easy walk - just enjoy the parking (omg, FREE parking in Buckhead?!?!) and go explore the city!\n",

      "  Review : My wife and I recently spent a weekend night here while attending an event in Atlanta. This property is an older hotel but has been remodeled in the last couple of years. It is conveniently located in the Buckhead area of Atlanta.Upon arrival the first room we were assigned was large but felt hard and not what you would call luxurious or very romantic. We requested another and were assigned a very nice room in another part of the hotel. The room had no carpeting which is a very nice feature that I wish more hotels would do. It makes the room feel much cleaner than some old nasty carpet. Our room was large with a king bed, large bath, plus another room with a sofa (sleeper), recliner, television, desk, table with four chairs, and a bar area with sink, coffee maker, microwave, and small refrigerator. The bed was very comfortable with nice coverings and pillows. The towels in the bath were your standard white hotel towels but were thick and absorbent.The hotel also has an exercise room which looked small but adequate for a quick workout. The pool and spa were located out behind the hotel. Both could have been cleaner. There were business facilities available as well.A very nice free breakfast is offered in the morning with a good selection of breakfast foods. There was even an older gentleman making omelets to order. The breakfast area staff were very attentive and friendly. It was crowded and they kept busy making sure tables were cleared quickly and that the food was replenished when running low.The hotel also has a bar but due to the lateness of the evening upon our return from our event it was closed and we were not able to use it's facilities.Parking is free.While this is a very nice hotel and I would recommend it to anyone who needed to stay in the area there are also many other fine hotels in the Buckhead area and I may try a different one next time just to see what they have to offer.\n",

However, the shuttle driver told us he could not pick us up at Chastain Park because the shuttle had left for the night and when we got back the hotel (via Taxi) the shuttle was sitting in front of the hotel. We were fifteen minutes late calling the shuttle when we were told that we needed to be outside by 11, to be fair.

We arrived back at the room enjoyed our night and woke up with little bumps on both of us. We are thinking there may have been bed bugs in the bed but are unsure.

      "  Review : This was a very nice stay at a great hotel which is close to many great dining establishments and attractions. We booked a grand suite with a private in-room two-person hot tub. I was worried that the \"two-person\" size stated might actually turn out to be too small for actual adults, but it was very roomy and we enjoyed it immensely. The suite was also quite spacious, more along the lines of a small home in square footage than what we expected! There was a dining area, a living room, a bedroom, and a bathroom with the aforementioned hot tub and a spacious shower! We enjoyed the security of the hotel, as well. We did not visit the swimming pool or outside hot tub, but noticed it looked well-maintained. The only (very minor) negative we saw was that one small shelf in the shower stall was loose. I reported it to the front desk upon checking out, so they could have their maintenance crew fix it. That did not detract from our experience one iota. We enjoyed our couple's night away from home very much and would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to enjoy a romantic stay!\n",

I do not remember the rooms having wood floors before as they do now. My only complaint is that the floors felt a little sticky. I do not think they were dirty. I just think the cleaning product left a sticky residue. I have had this happen before at my own home. The breakfast is great. The same gentleman was making the omelettes that made them years ago.

      "  Review : This was my first time staying at a Wyndham brand hotel and was looking forward to it! First person I came in contact was Marquis at the front desk. He was such a pleasure to deal with! I wish everyone would take notes of how funny and genuine he is. Room 221 was a little 'dark', it could use some updated led lights and maybe some overhead lighting or something. Bed was very comfy along with the pillows. Shower head was very powerful which is one thing I always look at, you didn't have to run around in a circle to get wet! Furniture in the room is a little dated, but overall room was better than average. The elevators took forever, and someone told me that the hotel had people working on them previously that week. Maybe it will get fixed, I told the front desk. My wife and I got up a little late for breakfast and got down around 9:30 which gave us about thirty minutes to grab what was left of breakfast. The staff seemed as if they couldn't keep up with the crowd of people and food was very sparse. So we grabbed a few pieces of bacon and there were two mini waffles left so we got those. I'm a pretty big guy so those 3 pieces of bacon and waffle the size of my fist left me still a little empty. We noticed there was a gentleman preparing made to order omelettes and there was a line so I got up and went over to get in line. After standing there a few minutes a lady walked up to me, with no name tag or nothing on showing she worked at the hotel, and told me the line stopped here and pointed at the man standing in front of me. I understand it was right at 10:00 but I find it a little unprofessional with only 3 standing in front of me. So I asked again just to make sure she wasn't pointing at me saying the line stopped at me because there was about 2-3 people that had just started walking up behind me to get in line. Rudely she said, \"No, it stopped at him\" and pointed back at the guy in front of me and turned around and walked away. All I have to say is, you know as a hotel how many guest are staying at your facilities. If you don't have enough staff to handle it then I suggest to hire more. My overall experience was good, I feel it could have been better considering the ratings and price notate this hotel was above average. \n",

We had a drink at the charming little lobby bar before taking the hotel's luxury shuttle to a fabulous nearby Greek restaurant, Kyma. Our driver, Ben, was very nice.At the end of the evening, we had another drink at the lobby bar and Marie was our server. What a lovely person. We all enjoyed chatting with her. The complimentary breakfast has the added touch with made-to-order omelettes and fresh waffles. In addition to coffee they have an espresso machine for lattes, capuchinos, Anericanos, etc., and even a cup warmer! Staff in the breakfast area were very nice, too. The breakfast area overlooks the pool patio, which looked clean and nicely landscaped. The stay overall was great. We were lucky because there were no large groups or conferences going on and the hotel was quiet. The only downside is the rooms are a tad worn and could use updating. It's not horrible but you do notice the wear. I'd definitely stay again. \n",

      "  Review : 5 star is an understatement! The staff is best! I have NEVER stayed at any hotel that greeted you daily by name! Each day upon leaving and returning the staff held conversations with us and asked if we needed any assistance to make our stay more pleasurable. From 1-10 the cleanliness of this hotel is 10....it smelled so good upon entering and someone was always wiping down furniture, elevators or shampooing the carpet. The chauffeur was AMAZING! He took us wherever we needed to go in style (which was a limo) and basically gave us a tour on our way to our destinations. He informed us of all the best places to shop and eat. I won't stay anywhere else but Wingate in Buckhead whenever I visit ATL! Free wifi, full hot breakfast, free printing and faxing in the business center and located in the prime location! Not to mention if you have Wyndham Rewards you get points, points and more points! We got enough points in 3 days to earn another free stay at any Wyndham hotel! We love this place!\n",

Don't have to pay to park, a pool, coffee machine in lobby that prepares custom coffees and a better than average breakfast. The only thing we don't like is the heavy comforter that I know is not changed between guests, the bed scarf and all the pillows. A simple blanket with top sheet is more than sufficient and can be laundered between guests.\n",

Especially when we go dancing at a nearby venue. The staff as always was great both morning and evening staff. The breakfast as said prior is also very good with fresh home made omelets and waffles cooked to order by a chef in the room. Add the free parking and what is not to like.

      "  Review : A group of 18 of us stayed one night for a concert, Friday August 12th, 2016. My boyfriend and I had a king size room and although the room was nice, it had a musty smell to it. The entire hotel, including the rooms, were very humid ( that is the only word I can think of to use!) After turning to AC down it did get a little better, but not 100%. I must say we did stay during the hottest time of the year so I am sure that played a part! The pool and hot tub were extremely clean, which was nice! Everything was clean!! The most wonderful thing about our stay was your staff!! They were ALL amazing, the front desk, the custodians, the servers and the limo driver we used to take us to the venue and back! You have the most amazing staff we have ever dealt with! They made our stay fun and comfortable! Every single one of them spoke to all of us as we passed by or rode the elevator with them! They go above and beyond and we sure hope that the employer treats them with the utmost respect because they deserve it! \n",

After the pool, we sat in the main lobby area where coffee was provided and chatted. We were told the bar closed at 11 and the lobby closed at midnight. (Another worker told us the bar could close at 2AM but they choose to shut down at 11 PM) I felt like I was in camp being told what time we had to be in our room with the lights off.

The location was convenient to attend meetings in Downtown Atlanta and sightsee, and the hotel amenities fit our lifestyle. Marquis and Marie, front desk representatives, were ALWAYS pleasant, friendly, and willing to assist in any way to make our stay enjoyable and a home away from home. The King Suite was the perfect size for our 15 month old to move about freely and explore. The contemporary decor and size of the room definitely made it a home away from home.Breakfast was delicious and the staff were friendly; always willing to make sure we were satisfied.

It had wooden floors, two large, comfortable beds, a fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. The housekeeping staff worked very hard to keep the rooms well serviced. There were a number of places to eat within walking distance. A good choice for a place to stay.\n",

      "  Review : Although this hotel was a little pricier than two others that were close with similar suites, they offer a shuttle to and from concerts at the park which is well worth the extra rate. This is not a new property (17 years old), but it has been continually updated so that you don't know that. FYI, booking directly through the hotel saved me $10 per night vs. Hotels.com. I checked in on a Sunday and after check-in the batteries in my door lock died. Marie at the desk was helpful (and was great over the two day stay - working the front desk, bartending and even cooking food all at the same time), Ben the shuttle driver tried to help as well. Miss T, who heads up housekeeping and has been an employee for 15 years, really came to the rescue by contacting Engineering who had already left for the day. After getting the needed info on how to change the batteries, she and I went looking for the right tool (which she is hopefully going to communicate to others in case this happens again as it is a specific tool) and eventually got the job done. The next morning she was helping out with breakfast as well! After that, everything was smooth sailing. Also, even with a Do Not Disturb sign hanging, housekeeping leaves a little bundle of extra towels and toiletries outside of the door for you.\n",

      "  Review : Having saw how GORGEOUS this hotel was online (especially the lobby), I was very pleased to see that the lobby was as BEAUTIFUL as it was online (no air-brushed photos here!)! Ms. Monique worked the guest desk - both when I came into town, and when I left, and with her BEAUTIFUL spirit, GORGEOUS face and personality to match - she went ABOVE and BEYOND the call of duty to make sure that my stay was so memorable, that not only did I NOT want to leave, I can't wait to come again - very soon! The entire staff was VERY accommodating and friendly! Charles cooked an AWESOME omelet the next morning - complimentary to the AWESOME buffet (those potatoes, sausages, and fruit - Whaaat? Yummy for the tummy!), that was laid out for us!! The EXECUTIVE SUITE was GORGEOUS, and you had this sense of living in ELEGANCE & EXTRAVAGANCE without the extravagant prices! I cannot wait to book with WINGATE by WYNDHAM again! If you're going anywhere near the Buckhead area in Georgia, and you want to be walking distance, and very close to TONS of restaurants, 3 Movie Theaters, Kroger's (in case you forget some things like I did...), etc. - you ABSOLUTELY MUST stay at WINGATE for ALL of the elegance of being there - with NONE of the elegant prices - BAM!!!!\n",

The breakfast was better than I have experienced in other limited service hotels like Holiday Inn Express, Homewood Suites and Hampton Inn. The rooms were clean an attractively furnished. The one negative was the bathtub had been refinished some time ago and the finish had worn through on the bottom.I was a little disappointed that the bar was closed by the time I got back from dinner my second night. \n",

      "  Review : We had an amazing stay at the Wingate in Buckhead. We were very impressed by the attentive service, great amenities and overall value. Free hot breakfast with a lot of choices, complimentary shuttle service around Buckhead (lots of shopping and dining options), coffee and cookies in the lobby, a well-appointed fitness center, a business center with printers and desktop computers, and the list goes on. All the hotel staff were so friendly and helpful. Monique at the front desk was very professional and exceptionally kind and helpful. From the very moment we walked in, she made sure we were comfortable and that every detail was handled quickly, with a personal touch. We were made to feel like \"guests,\" not \"customers.\" The room was comfortable and re-stocked daily with the amenities one needs. Beds were comfy. The only downside of our room was the wi-fi signal was so weak, it was pretty much unusable, whereas other locations around the hotel were fine. Don't know if it was just our room or other rooms as well. Calling the tech control center didn't help. We didn't notice noise being near the elevator, but we had to move after the first night, because of street noise. (And we were accommodated immediately, without any problem or question.) So ask for the rooms away from the street. Overall, this was a great hotel and we highly recommend it. Thank you, Monique and staff. :)\n",

      "  Review : We had just traveled 675 miles on our motorcycles and got caught in Atlanta traffic. We decided to stay rather than fight the traffic. We booked our room online and was at the hotel within 30 minutes. We were immediately greeted by Marie. We asked if there was an onsite restaurant and bar and she told us yes! We immediately went to our room and unpacked and showered. We went downstairs to the bar and ordered a couple of drinks/dinner. We proceeded to tell the bartender that this was the best Wingate we have ever stayed in and how awesome Marie was. Also, I loved the fact that there were hardwood floors in the room instead of carpet. We made casual conversation with the bartender and was intrigued by all the places he lived. Just kidding around, we asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. Boy, were we surprised when he shook our hand and said \"Hi, I am Burgess, the owner.\" I was shocked. He mentioned that his bartender had called out, and as an owner, you have to jump in and work where needed. Breakfast was delicious with fresh fruit, oatmeal, biscuits/gravy, potatoes, sausage, bacon, made to order omelets and so much more. We needed a night to unwind and this was definitely the place to do it. Thanks Burgess for a great Wingate by Wyndham experience.\n",

She was very polite and informative and was sure to fill us in on all the necessary details for our stay. Although our room was near the elevator, it was still very quiet. The room was clean and served it's purpose. Unfortunately, our door would never close upon exiting so we had to literally slam it VERY hard when leaving.

The pool was clean and the deck is right outside the breakfast area. Check-out was easy.

      "  Review : Clean, updated rooms with wood floors which were nice. Felt cleaner. BEST HOT AND FREE BREAKFAST EVER!! Ommellette sand waffles, biscuits and gravy, eggs, bacon, sausage, grits, oatmeal plus so much more! Only downside is the look of the outside and the surrounding area - was construction going on and looked dingy and borderline sketchy but had no issues at all. Staff was super nice and helpful. They have a shuttle to take you to local restaurants and shopping which is convenient if you don't want to drive but last shuttle is available for pick up 10 till 11. \n",

      "  Review : I booked this hotel because of my previous experience was wonderful. They have definitely changed. Check in went wrong from the beginning. I wanted a rest relax vacation. I was repeatedly told no parties on the room. Just because you see two young good looking people doesn't always mean we are inviting guest to party in rooms. Assumption gets you no where. The breakfast was the best part of the stay. The chef is the only one that really made you feel welcome. The same morning I went to the front desk to ask for more washcloths and the receptionist acted like it was a act of congress to give me two washcloths. Even has the nerves to say wasn't there some in my room. Really, really who wants to steal just two washcloths? Some people do have a need for more washcloths.\n",

      "  Review : Wow! The front desk worker (Marques) was very nice, accommodating, knowledgeable,friendly when we arrived and all thru the night. We were there for a concert and two nites. The van driver (Craig) was an excellent driver. Dropped us off and picked us up and was very professional. The room was okay, we found dirty socks under the bed, when we were looking for my shoes. This is unexceptable, because ur hotel was rated 4.5 stars. I did not report it to the front desk because that morning the young lady seemed irradiated, so I didnt want to cause more conflict. Soooo please have your housekeeping people to throughly clean the rooms including under the beds. I will keep you on my list for exceptional hotels but try and clean a little more better thru out the room.Thank you for listening Robin Harrisrh8284@gmail.com 404-889-9474\n",

      "  Review : We stayed here 3 nights over the Memorial Day weekend and loved it. We arrived earlier than expected, and the hotel allowed us to check in about 1 1/2 hour early (this would, of course, vary with the availability of clean rooms). The front desk staff was very friendly and professional.The hotel was quiet and the bed was comfortable. The complimentary breakfast was fantastic. The hot breakfast included scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage, biscuits, potatoes, grits, gravy, and oatmeal. There were pastries and fruit, and an attendant to make fresh omelets and waffles to order. We loved that they used real plates and flatware instead of paper and plastic.We chose this location because it is near the Atlanta History Center which we intended to visit. There are several good restaurants nearby, although one night we were so tired, we simply ordered in a pizza.Free wifi is provided, but the signal was very poor in the room. Aside from that, the only complaint we had was that the fitted sheet on our bed for the last 2 nights was too small for the mattress and kept coming undone at the head of the bed. Housekeeping would have probably changed the sheet if we had reported it, but it was more of a nuisance than a real problem, and we did not report it.We would definitely stay here again.\n",

But for the price ($156 for a two-bed room w/ 4 people) and being so close to downtown, I think it was a good deal. I'd have rated it as just average based on the room size, but the amazing complimentary breakfast and salon-quality mirrors they had in the bathroom (great for putting on makeup) bumped it up to 4 stars. The only thing I can complain about is how slow the elevator took... They should really think about updating it.\n",

All the food is fresh not microwaved. They have a limo driver with a Mercedes Bus on staff who will take you almost anywhere within I believe a 4 mile radius for free... great when you go out to Johnnys.

      "  Review : First, this review is no reflection on the staff. Everyone we interacted with was incredibly courteous, friendly, and helpful. Truly appreciated this aspect of the hotel. But beyond that, I was very unimpressed with it. The rooms don't seem to have been updated in forever. Our bed was uncomfortable and the sheets did not fit it; the fitted sheet kept popping off during the night. The window would close all the way but rushing air made a whistling sound as it came through, so we had to open the window which meant it was very cold at night. I understand this is not an upscale chain, but when compared with a Hilton Garden Inn or Hampton, this stands a class below. Would not recommend staying here unless nothing else is available in the price range.\n",

      "  Review : I had a great 4 night stay here in May 2016. The check-in process went smoothly, and all the staff I encountered throughout my stay were extremely friendly and helpful. I went to my room, and it was adequately equipped with amenities which included a microwave, coffee maker, refrigerator, safe, etc. To be honest, I found the beds to be a little sagging and difficult to sleep on. I did try both beds in my room and had the same result. The last night, I slept without a pillow, and that seemed to be a huge improvement. The room was very spacious, and comfortable. The room had a hardwood floor, which was nice touch. The bathroom was spacious, and plenty of counter space. The water pressure in the shower was great. The room was very clean. The window just had two roll up shades which were OK, but did not keep out light first thing in the morning. I don't watch much TV, but there was a huge TV in the room with lots of channels. Regarding the in-room wi-fi, I found it to be a very good experience. I often get frustrated with the wi-fi provided by hotels. It is usually slow (and they want you to pay to upgrade to premium), and there are difficult hoops to jump through to access it. The wi-fi here I found to be superb. It was fast and easy to connect to. You did have to re-access once a day, as you do most anywhere.The pool and hot tub are outside. That can be a plus or a possible minus, if it's raining outside. The breakfast each morning was great. It didn't have a ton of options, but there was someone there to make eggs / omelettes / waffles, and they were quite tasty. The seating area was adequate, and the layout was nicely arranged.I did not use the shuttle service, but they do have a shuttle that will take you within 3 miles, which is a nice perk. The business center is well equipped, and I was able to use that to print out my boarding pass. I did feel the price was a little high for this property. The weekend I stayed, hotel prices in general were higher most everywhere I looked. The quality is definitely there, so I would definitely return to stay here, and I would highly recommend this as a place to stay.\n",

      "  Review : This was our first stay at Wyndham Atlanta/Buckhead.Walls were very thin and I could hear clearly the people in the next room. When the female desk attendant changed our room she didn't look at my wife and I . There was also no apology whatsoever,she just put the new key on the counter and kept a straight face.. The next room had a broken air conditioner and a broken remote. When I called about the broken remote I had to go down to the desk from the 5th floor because there was nobody to bring it up,So now we moved to a nother room. Noise outside due to construction and the new room was smaller than the original at the same price! NEVER AGAIN!\n",

The best part of this experience was the staff and what they offered to us during our stay. Everyone was so polite and helpful! The limo shuttle driver was hilarious, polite and got us where we needed to go quickly! (And its free within a certain mile radius! Awesome addition!) The room was incredibly clean and spacious. The free breakfast also includes an omelet and waffle station with a staff member making you whatever you want hot and fresh. We will absolutely be back!\n",

He then gave me recommendations on nearby eateries and places to visit if I desired to do so while I waited.I informed him that I wanted to do some work while I waited and he informed me there was a quiet area for this. While I worked and waited he checked on me multiple times and then came over around noon to inform me that I could now check in.He was great!

      "  Review : Stayed at the Wingate by Wyndham in ATL/Buckhead at the first of April. Stayed in a room with 2 double beds. The beds were comfortable and the room was very roomy. I was a little displeased with the bathroom as the shower was a bit dirty and the showerhead was not strong at all, still nothing too bad that I couldnt manage. The only other complaint was the room just seemed a little outdated for the Wyndham as I expected a little nicer. Regardless it was a nice stay for one night in ATL. Would return again as I was pleased with the service and easy check in. The front desk also let me do a late check-out on Saturday! Thank you for that as it was much needed! \n",

      "  Review : Buckhead is a great place with a mall that has needless markup,Nordstrom and all the rest. There is even a Tesla store at the mall, but I don't shop. The fish market and Buckhead diner are fabulous. Whole foods is down the block. All that is icing and you can buy the cake at Mandarin Oriental and the likes.When I die as long as the casket is clean and the mortician friendly I'll be in heaven(LOL). The Wyndham is my idea of the perfect place to stay. All the staff including Marquis, Charles, Caleb and the beautiful front desk woman during the day makes this place feel like home rather than a motel. It is quiet but still close to all the places I listed above. I love free internet and free parking. Their breakfast is worth more than the price of admission and did I say it's free.

Once we got to the room I was undressing when out of nowhere our door open and there was housekeeping!!! I was horrified as I had on no clothes!!! She didn't say anything!! Not I'm sorry or anything!!! This was totally unacceptable!!

From the shuttle drivers to the breakfast attendants to front desk receptionists to housekeeping, all are gracious, attentive, and infuse that wonderful southern charm. Rooms were very clean, beds heavenly comfortable, meeting room well equipped. Some tips: Shuttle stops running at 11pm. The hotel is an easy Marta ride on the North Springs line, get off at Buckhead, call the hotel and the shuttle picks you up from there. It's faster than a taxi and considerably less expensive too. Recommend hotel for small to medium sized meetings.\n",

The breakfast chef was so pleasant and my omlet was wonderful. The only warning is the floors in the room are wood or laminate & in sock feet you will slip and slide...\n",

      "  Review : The front desk staff set the tone. They were kind, courteous and professional. I landed at the airport having misread the pickup policy, yet asking for a pickup. I was told by the Wingate front desk person that I needed to book it in advance. The front desk staff person gave me instructions on how to easily catch the train and make my way to the station nearest the hotel. Within minutes of arriving at the station, a driver in a very nice Mercedes limo van was there to pick me up. Few minutes later I was checking into the hotel. Prompt service with a smile. I was even moved up to a higher floor with a view of the pool. Got a great recommendation for sushi. The rooms were large, well furnished & immaculate. The website pictures of the king sized bed & large two person tub and two person shower are spot on. Great hot water and pressure. One minor personal issue, the bedroom pull down shades don't do nearly enough to keep out the sun but the bed was comfortable enough, I could have slept in all day. My only other personal gripe is that the pool is outdoors and coming from the north in February I would have loved a good warm southern swim. Got a late checkout. Too easy. Kudos for an oh-mazing stay-cation. \n",

      "  Review : Visited Atlanta on business and stayed at the Wingate for the week. Stayed in a suite and I must say it was more than I expected. There was a living room and kitchen with a nice desk and table with chairs for dining. The bedroom was separated by double doors and equipped with a nice King sized bed, large flat screen television and the bathroom was very luxurious. Large 2 person jacuzzi tub and large walk in shower. I was beyond satisfied with my room. I could have stayed in all week and been just as happy. The staff was very friendly and very accommodating. The shuttle took me to dinner one night, had me there early for my reservations, and picked me up promptly when I called. The hotel itself is within a mile of everything there is to do in Buckhead, so take advantage of the shuttle service if you don't like driving in Atlanta traffic. 5 star hotel at 3 star prices. Definitely staying again.\n",

      "  Review : We stayed two nights. Great experience. Would come back. The property is about 10-15 feet below the level of Piedmont Road and the back side faces apartment or condominium complexes, so it was very quiet. The staff was very friendly and helpful with dinner recommendations near the Lennox Square area. To avoid the monumental Saturday night traffic and parking hassle, we used the complimentary transportation. (Complimentary hotel vehicle is available from 7:00 AM to 11:00 PM within three mile radius of the hotel.) That will easily get you to the MARTA station, Lennox Square, Lennox Marketplace or Phipps Square. When we were ready to return, we called the cell number on the business card and both times were picked up very quickly. It made for a very relaxing evening.Breakfast was a great experience. Urns with coffee, tea assortment, espresso machine. Fruit cocktail of tropical fruits (papaya, mango, pineapple, pear and peach as near as I could tell) - I had two helpings on both days! Attended omelet station made to order. Hot breakfast items included eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits, gravy, oatmeal, and grits. The grits were EXCELLENT. Nice array of condiments for oatmeal; golden raisins, almond slivers, currant or champagne raisins, turbinado sugar. Three attendants at breakfast, so service was excellent. The room was nice. I liked the at-home feel created by the Pergo wood floor and the small Persian rug and stuffed chairs. Full length mirror is nice for checking appearance. Sturdy valet bench for suitcase, plus the standard foldout version. Very comfortable pillow-top mattress and an assortment of pillows. The bathroom was well-lit with indirect lighting around the edges of the mirror. This was nice for shaving, putting on make up, etc. The bathroom has a central exhaust system so there is no noisy fan.Room has mini-fridge and microwave. Nice sized closet contains a safe that is large enough for most laptop computers. Negative: Bedside table on only one side of the bed in this King Bed Suite. A very relaxing stay.\n",

      "  Review : We had a wonderful stay while at the Atlanta Show. Everyone at the hotel was very nice and helpful. My husband and I actually contracted food poisoning while dining at a local restaurant and the staff at the Wyndham were super helpful with sending gingerale and crackers to our room for us. We won't forget that and definitely stay there again! \n",

      "  Review : I was happy that the renovations didn't seem to be causing a lot of noise, dust and aggravation. There was in a new wooden floor installed in my room, it was very noisy to walk on with my shoes on and it had a section that had pushed up near the bathroom door, it is a trip hazard. I reported it to the front desk and was told that they would look into it.The comforter on the bed was very heavy and I had a difficult time getting to sleep, I finally had to take the comforter off the bed and get blanket out of the closet, problem solved. \n",

This hotel is basic business class and the furnishings in our room were showing some wear. However, the staff were very friendly, the room was comfortable (the bed was great), and the bathroom was spotless. The included breakfast was good and with more offerings than many similar hotels. Buckhead is a pricey location and this hotel is a great option. Would stay here again. \n",

The rooms were nice and cozy. The only thing I was not very impressed with, was the free complimentary WiFi, but that's something that can be addressed and fixed in a 1, 2, 3!Keep it going.

      "  Review : I had planned this overnight stay New Year's Eve as a Christmas gift for my husband. We were having dinner at Chops Lobster Bar and I wanted something close by. I saw all the great reviews and saw it was close to Chops so I made the reservations over 2 months before. Upon arriving, we found out when trying to check in that they had computer issues. We were the 2nd ones in a line of eventually about 15. It took 20 minutes to check in. I felt really sorry for the front desk folks. The room was very nice and I like the way it was laid out with a little sitting area and plenty of room. Our only problem was trying to find a place to park when we got back after dinner. Lots of young people in the lobby so I guess someone got a room and invited friends to hang out.Normally, I don't sleep well in hotels because of noise and the mattresses. We didn't hear a thing, even with there being lots of young people staying at the hotel. The mattress was just fine. Breakfast included someone making made to order omelets....delicious! Very close to Lenox Mall.Enjoyable stay overall.\n",

There had been flooding on the first floor and a generator to power a fan to blow into the first floor to dry it out was under our room window spewing out diesel fumes. The room smelled so bad that we asked for another room. Same problem. We were moved to a third room around midnight - exhausting. The internet was down the whole time we were there. We called and were transferred to a central team. They said our server was down and they would work on it. I don't know when it came back on, but not before we left. We did not have room service the first night we were there because their computer was down and they could not register us in the room were was finally given, so they didn't know to clean our room.

Someone in the hotel set off the fire sprinklers from trying to hang clothes from the spicket. I could see how this could happen. Minor issue.

Everyone flew in early on Friday a.m., and after lunch and a stroll around Piedmont Park, we 'boomers were ready for a siesta. Marquis (front desk) was enormously friendly and able to check us into our three reserved rooms an hour early. Long and happy story short, we were remembered by name by every staff member we encountered. Burgess, the owner/manager introduced himself to us in the bar on the first evening, and remembered us for the remainder of our visit, as did Craig, who drove us to/from dinner both evenings in the hotel's complimentary limo, and Marie, the hotel bartender. Every other staff member we encountered was equally above and beyond in their friendliness and willingness to be accommodating. The hotel was spotlessly clean, the beds/pillows comfortable, the rooms VERY quiet, and the included breakfast was more than ample. The best value I've experienced anywhere in many years. I was proud to entertain my friends here.\n",

      "  Review : I stayed at the Wingate - Buckhead in November. The service is excellent - front reception was always helpful and willing to go out of their way to make your stay a pleasant one. Room was spacious and clean. Breakfast was plentiful. Location is excellent if you need to be in the Buckhead area. I recommend the hotel. Only downside was the air conditioner is a bit noisy as is the bathroom vent if you are a light sleeper. \n",

      "  Review : I normally like to stay at Westins, but my friend needed to save some money. We picked the Windgate due to location close/buckhead and the bars in the area. You can't walk to anything, but there is a lot within close driving distance. Check-in went was easy enough. The room was in good shape, but it wasn't quite big enough for the furniture. Also, it is two doubles instead of two queens. The beds were comfortable. Bathroom was decent. The fridge was nice to have, especially when drinking. Once negative was that once you got the perfect temperature, the shower handle to control it would slowly start to move downwards, making it too hot after a few minutes. I am sure it is not like that in every room.Breakfast was good/decent. They cook omelettes but it is kind of odd, without using an omelette pan. The selection was good, especially since it was free.Overall, if this falls in your budget, I would recommend it.\n",

You can also use the limousine for further distance if planned in a timely manner for a small fee.

That in itself made it a valuable stay. But the room was large and the bed very comfortable, the noise level very low and the coffee excellent. We will stay here for all future Chastain Park visits.\n",

Complimentary parking, shuttle service, in room refrigerator, and microwave. Conveniently located in the Buckhead area. We would definitely stay here again but would check,recheck, and check again our reservations!!! We had booked several rooms with some specific request, such as handicap room, double beds for some, and some checking in a day before others, and after many conversations our rooms were not right!! But the staff did what they could to accommodate date us on this sold out weekend. Reasonably priced for a nice place. \n",

      "  Review : I reserved this suite for my husband and I so we could have a night on the town in Buckhead and not have to make the hour drive home. The hotel was nice and quiet and was convenient to everything. They offer a free limo or Executive bus service within 3 miles of the hotel, which was fantastic. The driver was very friendly and had a great attitude. My only complaint is that one of the hardwood floor planks in our suite was bowed up and was a definite hazard. We tripped over it several times during our short stay. (one night) It was located in a high traffic area of the suite so it was almost impossible to avoid. I think they should fix it before reserving that room for anyone else. (especially when you are paying over $200.00 per night)\n",

Free full brkfst served until 10 AM every day. The hotel staff is the best part...very friendly, knowledgeable about the area , good restaurants, etc. A real plus is free shuttle service to points w/ in a 3 mile radius of the hotel. A big thank you to Monique, Marie, and Craig! To put the level of service in perspective, we had a 7:00 dinner reservation at a restaurant about 2 miles away, and the shuttle service was overwhelmed w/ concert goers. The OWNER of the Wingate was in the lobby and volunteered to drive the 4 of us to LaGrotta in his personal Range Rover! Entrance to and exit from the hotel site is very good. I highly recommend!\n",

I called the Hampton in Buckhead and was able to get a room for the 2 nights we wanted. Big mistake!!! A chair in the room was broken, the room was very small, the bathroom was small and had terrible lighting , not appealing at all. I called the Wyndham to see if there was room for our second night and there was. Almost $100 dollars less!!! Will always stay at the Wyndham when we are in town!!!\n",

      "  Review : We were in town for the Chick-Fil-A Kickoff Game during Labor Day weekend. We knew we would return to our room Saturday PM to watch the evening games, so we got a 3rd floor suite. I felt we got a great value for our money. The property is very nice and well kept. It was a holiday weekend, so parking was somewhat crowded. The free hotel WiFi was so slow that I disconnected it. My friends had the same issue. I think the hotel was full this weekend, so that may have contributed to the WiFi issues. The front desk staff was knowledgeable, extremely friendly and handled our few requests quickly. Cookies were available in the lobby upon arrival and there were snacks and drinks available for purchase in the gift shop. We took the hotel shuttle to the nearby MARTA station to go to the Georgia Dome. The hotel does not have a full restaurant, but the bar area is very nice and the breakfast buffet is one of the best I have ever eaten in a hotel. My omelette was cooked to order and delicious and there was a wide variety of hot and cold breakfast foods available. Three to four staff members worked to keep the breakfast buffet orderly and stocked in spite of a fairly large number of people eating. We were very pleased with our room which was clean and spacious. The living area had a hardwood floors, dining table with four chairs, sofa, recliner and nice flat screen TV. There is a refrigerator, microwave, sink and bar area in the kitchenette. We had a nice area to watch the other football games with our friends after we returned. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was a good size. I have stayed in more expensive hotels in Buckhead, but feel this is a great value for what I wanted.\n",

      "  Review : very nice hotel in Buckhead area of Atlanta. Near Atlanta and History Center. Very nice breakfast and Staff. The only problem we have is our room was above the pool. The room was very bright till 3am..like dusk in the room because the Pool was very brightly lit. If you have trouble sleeping in a bright room ask not too to be in a room above the pool. The Staff was very friendly and the hotel was very well kept. It is also a bit noisy from mechanical origins above the pool. So stay away from the pool for a better nights sleep. I did call down in the middle of the night to the front desk. I was offered another room, but was not moving that late. I did ask for the phone call to be documented and it was. I asked to speak to a manager before we checked out but he/ she would not be in till past noon. So all in all a very nice property as long as you stay away from the pool area...Also make sure your mattress pad is cotton and not nylon. The sheets slip off the bed with the nylon mattress pad. The housekeeper was very pro active when I mentioned the sheet problem and had a nice cotton pad on for our second nights stay.\n",

      "  Review : As an Atlanta native, I have little experience staying in local hotels, but recently we sold our in town house and are living north of the city, so we decided to spend a rare weekend in Buckhead to reconnect with family and friends. This hotel couldn't be more perfectly located for anyone's visit to Atlanta. It is in the heart of Buckhead with public transport (MARTA) to downtown within a short walking distance, not to mention the biggest shopping Mecca in the Southeast right outside the door and wonderful restaurants nearby. The rooms are large and comfortable with a new, modern vibe and the staff is friendly and accommodating. Only downside is that the lobby can get quite crowded with large groups, but this was only an issue once or twice when cramming on the elevators. All in all a relaxing stay in my hometown!\n",

The breakfast is absolutely awesome with made to order omelets that simply make your mouth water. Front desk staff is always courteous and welcome us back on each visit. Loved our stay!\n",

      "  Review : This hotel was wonderful. Clean spacious room. Loved the hardwood floors. The service was also great. Wonderful breakfast with grits, eggs, bacon, fresh fruit, pastries, and waffles as well as made to order omlets. Monique at the front desk made sure we had a good plan to take Marta into downtown and to the aquarium. She treated us like family. And the shuttle limo was a lifesaver. The drivers , Ferris and Craig; were very nice and took us got to the mall, dining areas as well as the Marta station. I didn't move my car once which was good because I was very anxious about driving in the city. My girls and I had a wonderful trip thanks to this hotel and staff and we will definitely be back!\n",

      "  Review : Once again we stayed a Friday and Saturday night. As always the service was excellent and the staff very accommodating. The things we really enjoy about this hotel is convenient location to all things in Buckhead and Downtown area without the typical Buckhead Downtown prices. The hotel price includes free parking, free LIMO service that has been up graded to a Mercedes 22 passenger bus, and a free breakfast with an old time chef that cooks the best omelets around. The only reason we did not give it a 5 star rating was a small issue with housekeeping that was corrected immediately ( probably a lazy housekeeper) . We plan to return!\n",

      "  Review : I had the pleasure of returning to this property after a four year absence. I was very pleased to find many of the same smiling and friendly faces. The front desk staff (Monique & Chris) are wonderful. Monique remembered me from four years ago and was still as delightful in providing cheerful and informative recommendations on shopping and local attractions. I'm pleased to say the complimentary buffet breakfast continued to offer a variety of selections (hot & cold). I was never bored with the choices after four days. Special thanks to Mrs T and Chef Moore for providing quick and cheerful service with that morning cup of coffee and cheese omelette made to order. During my visit, I was able to take full advantage of the limo service provided by the property with a three mile radius. After arriving at Hartsfield Airport, I hopped on the MARTA train and within 20 mins. arrived at the Buckhead station where the limo quickly transported me to the property. If you are not familar was Atlanta roadways, I-75/I-85 is a beast with traffic and everyone drives extremely fast (70+ mph). Limo drivers Ferris and Craig were great in recommending local dining at Lenox and Phipps Malls. This property is a delight in the middle of Buckhead and convenient to Chastain Park and other Atlanta hot spots. Check out Twist Tapas at Phipps Mall. Food is excellent and the hotel offers a discount coupon.The spa pool and bar are an added bonus if you just want to chill out. Relax and enjoy while staying at this property because this staff will see to it that you do!!! \n",

      "  Review : We have never really had any loyalties to hotels...until now. We chose this hotel based upon location and the free shuttle service to Chastain Park Amphitheater, but the friendliness of the staff and the quality of the entire property has now endeared us to the Wingate brand. The entire staff were amazing brand ambassadors, especially the shuttle driver, Craig, who impressed us with his knowledge, wit and professionalism. The evening bartender and front desk clerk (sorry, we forgot your names) were very accommodating and professional, despite our late night antics. Southern hospitality is alive and well in this part of Atlanta, and we're already looking forward to our next stay. The only thing we'd change is to not stay in the same second floor room that overlooked the lobby/dining area, as it was slightly noisy during the morning.\n",

Hot breakfast with made to order omelettes was one of the best free breakfasts I've had at a hotel. Nice rooms with comfortable mattresses. Clean laminate wood flooring in room instead of dirty carpet. We had a two person spa in our grande suite which was very nice and relaxing. Would definitely stay again. \n",

      "  Review : I booked a room here because of the ratings on tripadvisor, but I didn't find our stay here to be much like what was described by the good reviews. The high point of our stay was the front desk service. I wish I could remember his name, because he was great - very friendly, hospitable, and professional. The room was nicely decorated, but in need of maintenance and not very clean. I liked that there was no carpeting on the floors, a hard floor also shows dust and dirt. There was dust around the walls and in the corners, and a small spider in a web. Paint and furniture were chipping, and the bed skirt and comforter were dirty in spots - we just kicked them off and slept with the sheets only. The decorative pillows were pretty, but not necessary - we put them on the chair to go to sleep. The material and thickness of the comforter and bed skirt are such that they cannot possibly be washed frequently. One of the white pillowcases was damp, so we tossed that pillow aside.The comforter was way too thick and heavy - I felt trapped before I kicked it off the bed. The air conditioning went on and off every 15 minutes or so, but it still felt muggy in the room all night. We had a room facing the street and it was noisy. The picture online made it seem that the hotel was further back from the street, but that is not the case - it is right up next to the street. Someone's car alarm went off for a long time in the middle of the night and woke us up. I understand that there was not much they could do about that though, and someone eventually took care of it. The beds were small (more like double-sized, not queen), and not that comfortable. I woke up with my back hurting a bit. The TV in the room was nice and we got a lot of channels. The pool was nice but much smaller than it appears online.The breakfast was not impressive - there were different kinds of eggs and waffles, bacon and sausage patties, but nothing for the kids to drink - they didn't have any milk or juice out - just coffee, tea, and an espresso machine. Thankfully we had chocolate milk and apple juice in our fridge left over from our trip.The trash cans in the breakfast area were still filled close to the top with beer bottles from the bar the night before.Overall, I guess I just expected more due to the rave reviews this place is getting. \n",

I was trying to use Wyndham reward points & wasn't able to get it to work on my phone, so she let me use the business center to try to book a room online with my points. Long story short I wasn't able to use the points, but booked the room anyway & it was well worth it. Double room was huge, shower was great, bed was super comfy with lots of pillows! Free breakfast was the best part. Full hot breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, biscuits & gravy, fried potatoes, mixed fruit, fresh fruit, and made to order omelets and waffles made how you like them! The ONLY negative I have is that the road is very close & I heard the cars all night, but I'm a very light sleeper, so that's not uncommon for me. In spite of that, I would definitely stay here again & recommend this hotel if you're staying in the Atlanta area!\n",

      "  Review : Loved everything about this place! Stayed one night here with family on the way to the north GA mountains and could not have asked for more. Friendly, smiling staff greeted us after a terribly long day traveling. We stayed in a king suite which was beautiful and well appointed with high-end decor and furnishings. The bathroom was spacious, well lit, and sparkling clean - the kids loved the HUGE Jacuzzi tub and I appreciated the large, glass enclosed shower with the elephant sized shower head. We had a pillow-top mattress that was so comfortable and fresh I think I fell asleep in less than 5 minutes. I did not want to get out of bed in the morning, but I'm sure glad I did because the complimentary breakfast was as fantastic as everything else about this hotel. Free wifi, free parking, and free limo service within a 3 mile radius of the hotel. The morning staff was just as friendly and sweet as the late night clerks. Apparently, this is a very well managed property and my whole family gave it an enthusiastic thumbs up.\n",

      "  Review : As a regional manager for my company, I travel at least 3 days a week and it is always important to find a hotel where I feel comfortable outside of my room as I really don't want to have to work from my hotel bed. Chris and Darby went above and beyond to meet the core values of customer service. I had questions about the area and although Chris was very busy attending to other customers checking in he took the time to make dinner suggestions and was great at multi tasking. The following evening, Darby suggested I stay for dinner at the hotel, I was concerned about the level of service I may receive as the hotel restaurant was extremely busy; however she never skipped a beat. I highly recommend this hotel because of the employees.\n",

      "  Review : The hotel was clean, well-kept and the service was top notch. Where the Wingate failed was the air quality of the building. This property has severe negative pressure issues which causes hot humid air to come into the building. This leads the whole building including the bedding to feel damp. I had to get a dehumidifier from the front desk and run it non-stop to remove the moisture from the air. The dehumidifier was removing around a gallon of water every 1.5 hours. This is a serious problem and can lead to mold and mildew problems.\n",

I really like the dark hardwood floors. The bed was spectacular! Nice fluffy pillows, very soft, high thread count sheets and super soft pillow top mattress. I felt like I was at home. The pool was very small but adequate enough to take a quick dip and lay out. The breakfast in the morning was one of the best \"free\" breakfast at a hotel I've had. There was a chef making omelets however you like. The grits were supper yummy and the coffee and cappuccino machine was icing on the cake! The only con I would say is that I booked the hotel on Orbitz and you cannot get credit for you stay on your Wyndham loyalty account unless you book it directly through Wyndham.Overall, I definitely will be staying at this hotel again. Especially when I attend another concert at Chastain Park. The hotel provided a limo service to our concert and they picked us up!\n",

Upon arrival, I stood at the front desk for too long listening to the two workers talk and never greeted me. Finally we were checked in. The lobby looked dated and the elevators smelled like hot burning elevator parts. Upon entrance to my room everything looked old and dated. Furniture was not nice, colors were awful, it felt like I was staying at my great grandma's place. Once I got ready for bed I pulled back the blankets and found blood spots on my sheets. The front desk said I could come get new sheets and change the BED OURSELVES. The next day there was at least a 20 minute wait to get on the elevator because only one was working. The front desk acted like they could care less about any of my concerns. Breakfast and the pool was okay but nothing special. Would not recommend this place to ANYONE!\n",

      "  Review : I was unsure if this was going to be a good experience when I entered the building b/c my colleague and I had missed our first night's stay and the man who greeted us acted like he could care less. He was rude and dismissive. I asked him if he could waive the extra magically appearing $30 Atlanta travel tax and he said that he could not help me with that. If the room had been booked and paid for for 6 nights, I didn't understand how they could charge us more because of a new tax. Hey Atlanta, don't you think we spend enough as travelers in your beautiful city already? Breakfast the next morning made me forget the whole ordeal, for the moment. A nice lady made us some awesome omelets. By the way, the room was very comfortable. The third morning it became even more wonderful. Chuck, our 87 year old chef, soon to be 88 on August 1st, made us the most delicate and perfect omelets I have ever had outside of my house. He was a joy to watch and the conversation was very entertaining. I recommend you always engage the workers in a conversation. I was excited to know he would be cooking for the rest of our stay. In my opinion, Chuck is this hotels finest asset. The cappuccino machine made us very happy as well. I will have to admit I had two every morning and one to go! This location is very centrally located to lots of eateries and just minutes away from SCAD Atlanta where our class was located. The pool was nice and clean and the room was always up to par and we felt very safe. \n",

I had a 3 night stay during which the floor was repaired once, only to buckle again in another area. Although I set the air-conditioning to 68 and then 66, the air would not dry. My paper documents wilted in less than 10 minutes. My clothes were damp and smelled like the room after a night there. The sheets wede damp.The experience made a long trip seem to be much longer.

It was nice to know that after getting in around 2am from a late flight that the front desk was waiting for us to check in. Everything was perfect with our room and quick check in process. The rooms are clean and have laminate floor instead of dirty carpeting like most hotel rooms. The breakfast that is included is a hot breakfast with many options and very good. The area is close to everything and easy to find. Only tip for noise is to get a room towards the back of the hotel, due to street noise in the front, although it wasn't too crazy. Also if you need to get to anything within a 3 mile radius, they offer a complimentary shuttle service in a nice limo shuttle\n",

The bathroom and shower was excellent (nice size and good water pressure) Staff were all awesome, friendly, and welcoming! Location was great with a lot of restaurants in walking distance if you like to walk. They have a stretch Benz shuttle which I did get a chance to ride in.

Within minutes of our favorite restaurants and the limo shuttles you to them for free!! Jackpot. We were in the grand suite which was sparkling clean,enormous and super quiet. And had a two person jacuzzi!!! Free breakfast including omelette and waffles made to order, fresh tropical fruit, delicious real meats, pastries and cereal and the usual breads and bagels. Personnel are WONDERFUL!!!! More than helpful and even offering what you didn't know you needed!!! Lovely super clean pool area with hot tub. There were a few annoyances. Only one nightstand. No blackout drapes. Loud air conditioners. Poor internet connection. But these minor annoyances could not spoil our happiness at this jewel of a hotel. We cannot wait to return!!\n",

From the exceptional front desk service; Marie, Alan, Marquese, and Chris, to the bar (yes there is a bar!). The bartender, Darby, was beyond kind, courteous and above all else personable. She goes above and beyond that which is requested of her. When I visited on a Friday evening there was a wedding party and concert. With how many patrons were around the bar area she still managed to talk to everyone without missing a beat. In closing, I will never be guessing which hotel to stay at when I am in the Buckhead area. Kudos to Wingate by Wyndham!! \n",

      "  Review : Hallways and elevators were as humid as a sauna. Our room air conditioner did not work. It was blowing in the outside air which was very humid. I tested the temperature and humidity using a Samsung app and it said 80 degrees and 91% humidity. It was about to start raining with those numbers! We spent several hours trying to resolve the issue. To their defense, the overnight desk agent allowed me to look at two replacement rooms. 1 room was on the same floor and had similar air cooling problems, though it wasn't AS bad. So I'm running back and forth between rooms, trying to determine which is best, going on no sleep and a long drive. The next floor up's room was significantly better and we chose that room. We got to bed at 4:30am. The next morning I spoke with the desk clerk about comping us for that terrible first night experience. He said he didn't think that was possible, because we DID sleep in *A* room and even a better suite than the suite we paid for. I explained that I missed a webinar, because I was supposed to be in bed earlier than 4:30am, and I missed the free breakfast as well because I woke up so late. He was very \"diva\" and acted as if I was personally insulting his dog. My complaint was strictly business. You don't put a customer through what we went through and expect them to pay, especially not when you're doing hospitality. Our bill at checkout had approximately 1/2 off for that first night. I called the corporate office at Wyndham and requested intervention. The next day I received a call from the gentleman who provided 1/2 off, and he said he would gladly comp us with a free night.\n",

The staff is charming and very accommodating. There is a free shuttle to wherever you'd like to go within a few miles. The only bad thing is that people can smoke out by the pool, which ruined my pool experience, as there are always several people out there smoking. In this day and age with most top hotels going smoke-free on their properties, Wyndham should follow suit. I felt on display while trying to enjoy the pool, with people camping out at all the tables outside to smoke, on a continual basis. It took away considerably from the classy effect they are pulling off in every other way. One woman sat out there in sweat pants for hours at a table, and smoked one cigarette after the other while having an extended telephone conversation. I felt like I was intruding on the smokers, while being the only one actually using the pool Room was damp to the point of being uncomfortable, too, but we figured that must be a Georgia-in-the-summer thing, as we experienced the same thing the night before, in Southern Georgia. \n",

This is just that location plus a very pleasant drive into the hotel via a ritzy neighborhood and ritzy leaving up to Chastain Park. We are gawkers when it comes to nice homes. The staff were very nice. The rooms also quite nice but I did not care for the bed. They had a bulky covering on the bed which I think they were trying to make the bed more comfortable but was not achieved. I pulled back the top and found a pillow top mattress so not sure what was going on there. Otherwise, nice room.The breakfast was VERY GOOD. The chef on duty coked up small waffles and they were to die for! Lordy I went back for more.Mom and I took a peek at the pool - NICE. They also had a nice and quaint but sufficient work out room.I would stay again if I were visiting Chastain Park or close by.\n",

      "  Review : Prices for area hotels were really up this year for the race. I guess because it was a Saturday night. This was our first time staying at this hotel so we did not know what to expect. First they do have free parking which is nice for a downtown hotel, second they had a great hot breakfast that started early enough for us to enjoy before the race. After checking we enjoyed the hot tub and pool. We were very pleased with our room, microwave, fridge and wood like floors with an area rug and a sitting area. Very comfortable bed and very clean. The only downside was we had asked for a later checkout (1 extra hour) and they said no but we over heard someone else being given a later check out so we were somewhat disappointed in that. About 1.5 miles from the start of the Peachtree and a little farther to Marta but not a big deal. Would stay here again.\n",

I was unimpressed with the cheap flooring which is sort of what you'd put in a house, not in a business. The AC could barely keep up with the 90 degree Georgia days. The bed was comfortable. The ceiling in the bathroom started leaking the one day that it rained. The tub was nice. For 240 a night there are actual luxury hotels in Buckhead. The oddest part of the huge room is it had one tiny closet, and the bathroom didn't have a separate toilet room.\n",

      "  Review : From check-in to check-out, this hotel is top notch. Friendly staff, willing to help out in anyway they can. Exceptional breakfast options - like none I've ever seen. This was not your typical carb fueled breakfast of sweetened cereal, white bread, and pastries. A chef was there ready to make you an omelet, granola, grits, oatmeal, biscuits, meat choices, fresh fruit choices (more than just bananas and apples), a cappuccino machine...I am home now and miss the breakfasts. Clean outdoor pool area and exercise room. The hotel rooms were fabulous. Ample parking. Great lunch and dinner option within walking distances too. Can't go wrong staying here, whether for business or pleasure. \n",

      "  Review : The hotel itself is fine, like any hotel. The basic problem is that Atlanta downtown is something like 20-30 minutes away by car. They have a shuttle but it does not run very late. The beds in our room were not very big and it was hard to share a bed with someone, and, of course, the windows didn't open, which was super sad on beautiful fall days. I get that is probably a typical hotel thing, but it was kind of awful.\n",

I surely suggest that if you are in the area and are in need of a great place to stay with awesome people and service, choose Wingate by Wyndham in Atlanta, Georgia!Thank you so much Wingate by Wyndham, you have made such a difference!!Sincerely and educationally yours,Christopher\n",

The staff was very friendly from the front desk to the chef to housekeeping, made you feel at home. Can't say enough about the room, perfect! Buckhead is a great part of town with restaurants and shopping nearby. The hotel has a shuttle & limo at your convenience if you don't want to fight the Atlanta traffic. Breakfast was delicious, they will even make you an omelet any way you like.\n",

      "  Review : Growing up in Atlanta, with my elderly dad still living in the same house I grew up in, I never expected I'd have to one day find a hotel room near my childhood home allowing me to have a \"base\" while visiting. . .but that's exactly what I had to do over this past weekend. I had to find a hotel room close enough to my dad that I could use as my base as I spent time helping to get him get ready for a medial procedure that was taking place early Monday morningI wanted a nice, clean, yet affordable hotel, that was both safe and convenient. All of which I found in the Wingate by Wyndham. I had compared staying at hotels that were within the same travel area such as the high end St Regis and Buckhead Ritz as well as the Marriott and Westin but it was the Wingate that had all that I needed. Free Wifi, a free hot breakfast buffet (that was excellent), convenience, cleanliness, safety, easy in and out as far as checkin and checkout were concerned. . . The hotel is just off the busy Roswell Rd located on Piedmont Rd--very convenient to the major arteries in and out of Atlanta. The parking is great and the hotel offers a free limo shuttle within a certain radius to the major nightlife and shopping meccas found in Buckhead.The hotel is in an area that is convenient to some very good restaurants with several being within walking distance (Zoe's Mediterranean Kitchen, Flip Burger, TinLizzies to name but a few) I booked my room on the hotel's website without any problem and physically checked in Sunday afternoon at 3--at their requested checkin time. The hotel is nestled off the road tucked in the manicured shrubs and trees creating a bit of a refuge sense upon arrival. The lobby is spacious, open and airy. The manager was warm and welcoming. A plate of cookies greeted all guests.My room was on the 3rd floor with a tranquil view of the surrounding woods---that's one nice thing about the Buckhead area of Atlanta--it is said a squirrel never has touch the ground for all of Atlanta's beautiful old trees.My room did have a damp humid feel and the AC never quiet cooled the room down adequately.The room was however exceptionally clean. King size bed, writing desk, mini fridge, microwave, recliner, flat screen TV, granite counter in the well lit bathroom. . . The bed was not the most comfortable, lumpy feeling so I did not sleep as well as I would have liked--tossing and turning as I was also hot. Breakfast the following morning was great- Hot scrambled eggs, bacon, grits, sausage, hash browns, breads, muffins, fruits, cereals, waffles, juice, coffee, tea, cappuccino, etc. . Despite my visit not being one of pleasure or long enough to truly enjoy my stay, the Wingate was a great choice. I would proudly and highly recommend this hotel to any visitor to the city--be it for work or pleasure. A great base to come explore all Atlanta has to offer.\n",

The delicious free breakfast, with made-to-order omelettes, added considerable value. The bed was exactly the right combination of firm mattress and soft surface for a good night's sleep. It was easy to connect to the internet, and the signal was strong and reliable. The bathroom had a great shower with several spray settings and plenty of counter space for toiletries. There were comfortable chairs and a desk in the bedroom. We appreciated the small fridge, which we used to chill champagne for our anniversary celebration. \n",

We called ahead as we were later than expected and it was nice to hear them quote my name when acknowleging that they were still expecting us. The rooms were amazing. So clean and the decor in the hotel was so lovely that we were pointing to many things we would like to have in our homes. The bed was soooo comfortable that we all slept like logs on both days. The shower is to die for. It has a massage feature that is a \" must try\" and the water was hot with a great stream. Breakfast cosisted of hot and cold items and there was a good sellection. Different breads, made to request omelets, potatoes, grits, sausages, oatmeal and the waffles OMG as light and tasty as could be. There was an elderly cook making the waffles who was a sweet as could be. All the reception staff were polite and had a smile and a pleasant word. My dad tried the pool and jacuzzi and seemed to relish the experience. There were fresh towels in a container and a place to rinse off near the pool. You could access the pool through a side door instead of walking through the dining room. We certainly gave the hotel TWO THUMBS UP and I we have now declared that the Wingate has raised the bar!!! Also before I forget, parking was free and it was easy to find a spot close to the entrance to the lobby. We were less that 20 mins from downtown and close to a shopping mall and retail stores... there was even a starbucks less than 2 mins away. Facilities to make hot beverages were in the room as well as a microwave and min fridge. I would definately stay here again if in Atlanta!!!\n",

      "  Review : Stayed here for 2 nights while attending a local graduation for family. Front desk staff was outstanding and breakfast better than most hotels. 2 beefs - like most hotels these days, they use small pillows. It's hard to sleep on them no matter which hotel you are staying at. The neighborhood was quite, but also like most hotels, the A/C unit was noisy. Other than those 2 things, this place was a great place to stay and all staff were very helpful and friendly. An added bonus is that they provide free limo service within a 3 mile radius, so if you want to have a dinner with wine or a cocktail, no worries - just use the limo!\n",

      "  Review : We were in Atlanta for our 20th wedding anniversary and decided to stay at the Wingate in Buckhead. In the last year we have stayed there three times. The rooms have always been clean and the staff has always gone out of their way to be kind and helpful. This time they went the extra measure to make sure that we enjoyed our visit. We attempted to take the provided limo transportation to dinner, but it proved to be difficult because of the number of guests utilizing this perk. We decided to drive ourselves. In the past we have taken the limo and it was convenient.Pros: Location in Buckhead, cleanliness, friendly staff, adequate breakfast, limo transportation to local eateries.Cons: Pack your patience when dealing with local traffic. The last mile to the hotel took us 30 minutes.\n",

I was surprised to see the shiny hardwood floors and the bathroom was very clean. We received very courteous service from the staff. The room was very quiet as most of the occupants seemed to be primarily business people…no slamming doors. They also have irresistible cookies in the lobby in mid-afternoon. Con: The only real con was the noise coming from the street, so select a room towards the backside of the building. We stayed here 4 nights, and it would have been nice for the breakfast to be varied.\n",

      "  Review : For some reason, hotel chains swap properties and names as a matter of routine. I have stayed at this property at least 4 times and it has been a Ramada, a Wyndham and now a Wingate. OK, I know that Wingate is a subsidiary of Wyndham so that detracts somewhat from my statement, but the assertion is nevertheless true. The good news is that this has been a fine hotel under whatever name it happens to be. This year, I was able to check in early, had a roomy and comfortable king room and in general had a very good stay, as have been my others (Atlanta traffic, not withstanding!). I also got a very good rate as part of a special package, so that was a plus. My only complaint is that my room was located on the north side of the hotel on the freeway side of the building which resulted in some road noise. White noise from the a/c fan canceled it out to some extent, but choose a room on the south (backside) section of the hotel.\n",

      "  Review : One of the main reasons I stayed at this hotel is its #3 TripAdvisor ranking of hotels in Atlanta. After my stay, I was surprised of that extremely high ranking, especially since I was just at the Westin Buckhead a few days prior and felt I had a better experience at that hotel. Pros: The breakfast was very good. I loved how the omelettes & waffles were freshly made in front of you. Though I didn't use it, the limo/shuttle was convenient. Free parking perk was awesome! Wifi was strong and my room was very clean.Cons: Small gym. It's between the front desk and the elevators so you'll see a few people casually looking at you as you work out. The walls were quite thin since I heard other doors being shut and footsteps/conversation from the hallway. The MARTA is at least a 25 minute walk.For a hotel to be ranked #3, I just expected a much better hotel. In terms of service, there was no one at front desk when I first arrived, waited 15 seconds to see a nice lady talking on her cell phone to the point where I wasn't sure if she's talking to me or to the person on the phone. Despite the dismal first impression, overall the service was pretty good.\n",

      "  Review : This was number 4 hotel on our U.S. trip and the most disappointing. People who read my reviews will know I try to be fair. We booked Wingate on the strength of other reviews on Tripadvisor and I can only speculate that those reviews were from people who only overnighted in the hotel.On check in we were allocated a room overlooking the foyer and the noise was unbelievable. So the desk clerk kindly moved us up to the fifth floor, as we would be staying for 4 nights. Unfortunately the noise was just as bad here. We had to wear earplugs to sleep. The suite was large, good bed -pity the bed linen was on inside out. The bathroom was good, a limited supply of toiletries not replenished daily. Housekeeping was NOT of a high standard. The bins were not emptied on day one, the cushions were lying on the floor when we came back to the room, clean towels thrown in a pile on the rack. It was as if the room attendant was interrupted and forgot to come back to finish. There was a slight improvement over the next few days but we know the beautiful wooden floor was never swept.This hotel has a small pool and hot tub at the rear. Towels are supplied on request. The main pool was unusable as there was a lot of debris floating on it.There are really good things about this hotel also - the breakfast is the best we had while in the U.S. with fresh omelette and waffles made to order and a plentiful supply of good fresh food. A fab coffee machine also. The shuttle bus is a great bonus - thank you to the drivers who drove us around Buckhead and acted as informal guides and advisers.For business guests this hotel is perfect but for a couple on holiday not quite so good.\n",

A couple recommendations/concerns I left with the hotel included: replacing a dead light bulb, spa tub settings other than on/off did not work, and providing drinks in the fridge billable to the room if consumed. Other than that, my fiance and I had an amazing stay.\n",

      "  Review : Our family of four absolutely loved our stay. The room was large, clean, and quiet. I loved the wood floors ~ they seem cleaner to me over carpet. The shuttle will take you anywhere you'd like within 3 miles of the hotel and pick you up again. The free breakfast was outstanding! Far above and beyond other complimentary breakfasts we have encountered. The 24 hour coffee nook was a nice touch along with the cookies my daughter enjoyed too much. Every staff member we encountered was a joy. I would highly recommend the Wingate to my family and friends.\n",

      "  Review : My usual Atlanta hotel had no vacancies during my recent trip, so I tried the Wingate by Wyndham with some trepidation. It met and exceeded all my expectations and requirements. The room rates were reasonable and included much more than many extended stay hotels I've stayed at the past. There were made to order omelettes and waffles every morning, carafes of hot and cold water available all day, including a cappuccino/espresso maker. There was a limo that could be used anywhere within 3 miles of the hotel, and the room was very clean. One day I didn't leave the room til late in the day, but came back to find a bag of clean towels by the door. The hotel staff was always friendly and helpful. Next time I plan a trip to Atlanta this will be my first choice hotel.\n",

This time however the front of the building was being painted and of course our room was on the front. Upon entering the room it smelled like fresh paint. I asked if we could switch rooms and was told the hotel was full and they were finishing up then with the painting (it was another 3 hours before they finished.) I then asked if the limo could take us to a certain restaurant and was told no that it was one mile too far. No sorry or anything. For a top tier hotel stay it wasn't.

I did the drive from the hotel to the Georgia Dome (downtown), and it took about 15 minutes, so not too bad. Only downside: They have breakfast, but they cut it off at 9am.

Also FREE limo service anywhere in Buckhead. ?Above and Beyond? Last night at dinner we went down to catch the limo to our restaurant. As we exited the elevator we see the tail lights of the limo heading off. So we waited for its return. 15 minutes, 20 minutes passes. The desk clerk called the restaurant to warn of our late arrival. Still no limo. The desk clerk called us over. \"The manager will take you.\" Chatting in the car, we learn that this is not the manager but it is the owner. This is ABOVE AND BEYOND.

We did not expect to stay here, we were very stressed out, we were exhausted, and I had a sleepy, hungry baby strapped to my chest. The woman who checked us in (Marie?) was just so caring and sweet; when our food came, she got it for us so the baby wouldn't be disturbed. The room was very neat; I thought the rug on the floor was a nice touch. The bed was very comfortable and big enough for the three of us when necessary. (We got a crib for the baby, but he did not sleep well after our stressful day.) The bar had good beer selections. The breakfast was superb--my son loved the fruit, scrambled eggs and sausage. Al, who was working that morning, was just wonderful and personable. Having the shuttle take us to the MARTA was a great touch, and it was fun riding in a limo-like vehicle. If I am back in Atlanta with time to plan for an overnight, I would DEFINITELY stay here again.\n",

      "  Review : My family and I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for about 10 wonderful hours on a Saturday night. We stayed in room 107, king bed, ADA accessible and comfy. The story is that we were returning from Montego Bay Jamaica and when we landed in ATL our 2nd flight was cancelled. By the time we cleared immigration and customs all hotels anywhere near the airport were full. We did a little searching for a nice place that could provide us with a crib or pack-and-play for our 1 year old baby and found this hotel. They were VERY nice on the phone and even nicer in person. We took the expensive cab ride from ATL ($50 with tip) to the hotel and went to check in. The woman behind the counter was amazing. She was friendly, efficient and quite helpful. We checked in, got a quiet room just off the lobby and the pack and play was delivered to our room within minutes.  The bar has food late night, but we ordered in from delivery.com because, well that is just what we do. We grabbed beers at the bar, good selection of 6 drafts and $4 drafts.The bed was super comfortable, the room was very clean and came with a microwave, refrigerator, a small little coffee machine and a lock box. We were not there long enough to shower or do much other than brush our teeth and try to sleep.BREAKFAST!!!! Well, Sunday am came early and breakfast at this place is amazing. #1 coffee machine I have ever seen at a hotel. They had a real italian style espresso / cappuccino machine. It was very nice, I had 2 cappuccinos. In addition there was an omelette bar, breads, bacon, sausage, fruit, yogurt, juices, etc..... one of the best hotel breakfasts I have had.I never thought I'd end up in Buckhead.... but this place was fantastic in our book.\n",

      "  Review : My husband, two children (8 and 7 yrs. old) and I just returned from the long weekend at Wingate in Buckhead. Check-in was very pleasant, as was the staff. We booked what we thought would be a King Suite. When we arrived at the room, the \"Suite\" wasn't really a suite as it had no doors to separate it from the rest of the room. There was only one TV which was too far to watch from your bed. When we asked for a different room, we were told there was no \"Suites\" available until the next day and we would have to pay more. We decided it was worth it, but we were stuck in the room for one night. That was our first night of no sleep. The room was on the 5th Floor facing Piedmont Road. The windows were paper-thin and you could hear every car, truck and ambulance which drove by. Another issue was the air-conditioning/heater units which were extremely loud whenever they'd turn on.For parents with small children: The windows open completely and have no screen for protection so be very careful!!!The following day we switched to the room which was actually a suite. Nice-sized room with great big jacuzzi tub although a bit out-dated. We requested to be away from the noise of the front of the hotel so the room faced the back. We were excited about the prospect of sleeping better until the garbage trucks came at 5 a.m. and scared us awake. Same issue with the air/heater units.The room has a microwave, sink and refrigerator but don't expect any supplies such as paper towels, etc.Breakfast was wonderful. Many options and cook-to-order eggs. The business center was very useful, as was internet access.The staff was very pleasant and helpful.If they'd invest a little in updating the hotel with noise-cancellation windows and new air/heater units, this would be a great place to stay. However, if you want a good night's sleep, don't stay here.\n",

Marquise and Monique are great (you 2 really should be given an award for excellence with the service we received). All smiles for us, we will return for sure. We have stayed @ some very expensive hotels but NONE compared to the staff here, (service). The driver and chef deserve acknowledgement also, because you gentlemen were great! Thank you for the reservations & all the accommodations, Marquise & Monique. Thanks again for the canopy bed & finally a jet tub that my husband can fit comfortably into, he really appreciated that.

      "  Review : My fiance' and I, along with my daughter, stayed at this hotel in March of 2014 on our way home from Orlando. I had originally made this reservation over the phone through the main reservation center. However, the man who placed our reservation did so at the wrong hotel. When we arrived at this hotel at around 10 p.m., we were told we did not have a reservation at this hotel, but the woman working the counter (I believe her name was Marie Johnson) told us they had rooms available, and that I could use their phone to call the main reservation center to cancel our previous reservation at the wrong hotel. So I did. However, when I called the reservation center from the hotel lobby phone, the man I spoke with told me that we were not able to cancel our reservation at the wrong hotel. It was late, I was tired, and needless to say, a little ticked off. Just then, the woman working the counter asked me if she could have the phone to speak with the reservation agent, so I handed it over to her. This woman was amazing! She quickly took hold of the situation and was able to get this man to cancel our previous reservation and refund my money. After the phone call, she quickly got us into a room at the right hotel.The room itself was a bit small but absolutely gorgeous. It had a kitchen, small dining area, a pull-out sofa (which was perfect for my daughter) in the living room, a king-sized bed with doors that closed the bedroom off from the living room, and a huge bathroom with a jetted tub, separate shower, and large vanity. The room was immaculate - not a speck of dust or dirt to be seen. In addition, we were given a card at the front desk for the driver's cell phone number, as this hotel offers FREE limousine service up until 11 p.m.!Overall, the room was one of the nicest I have ever seen on my travels. As for the service? Well, if you call the reservation center, make sure they know exactly which hotel you are looking to stay at. If not, just ask for Ms. Johnson when you check in. This lovely woman went above and beyond and, in my opinion, has some of the best customer service skills I have ever had the pleasure of encountering. She deserves a promotion!!!\n",

Even on the phone, when I spoke with Chris and another employee who called to confirm my stay, they were both on point. The 82-yr old, young man who prepared breakfast the morning of Dec. 31st had returned to work after an accident. His fellow employees displayed such genuine concern and happiness to see him return...that was special. Cons: 1-We were told our hotel was booked for the new year holiday, which meant a shortage of parking spaces and we had to be creative. And when we settled in our room, which had an adjoining door, we were able to hear our neighbors conversation and thought 'uh-oh'. But it ended up not being an issue for the entire stay...maybe he checked out.\n",

Everyone was very nice, even the guy who makes omelettes in the morning. In fact, the cookies in the afternoon and the free breakfast were very nice. The room was modern and had all the amenities you would expect BUT here's the rub for me - I'm tall and I was shocked at the height of the room. It couldn't have been more than 8 feet. Most hotel rooms are much larger these days. OK, so you're not as tall... then I would suggest you stay here. It's certainly very nice but having stayed at the St. Regis and some other prime Atlanta digs, this is not #4.\n",

      "  Review : This was a lovely hotel. I took my mom to Atlanta for her 50th birthday. The staff were very friendly from check in all the way to check out. The front desk people were always smiling and making jokes with my mom and I. They were informative about the area and we had no problems with our reservation or payment. The hotel is located close to many things (shopping and places to eat) in walking distance. I was really excited to surprise my mom with the complimentary limo service (runs from 11a-11p, I believe), but the limo wasn't running at the time. I was saddened about that, but they had a shuttle type van/bus that took us to dinner instead. The driver was very friendly, as well. The hotel room itself had hardwood floors, which was amazing for my usually terrible allergies. The housekeeping staff came to our room after our first night there and cleaned wonderfully. On my next trip to Atlanta, I will def. stay in this hotel again.\n",

      "  Review : We were on a quick getaway to Atlanta when a cold overtook me and abruptly ended our trip. But, the saving grace was that this hotel had a recliner in the room - and it allowed me to get some sleep that night. The beds were also very comfy - my husband slept very well. While not a brand new hotel, the rooms were very clean, the staff friendly and efficient, and we liked the wood floors vs. carpet. I would definitely stay there again for the location, price and condition of the hotel. One caveat: our room had an adjoining door and a couple checked in around 11 and were pretty loud for about an hour, so be sure to request a room with no adjoining door. We didn't use the free limousine but what a great idea.\n",

      "  Review : This was our first trip to Atlanta, and the TripAdvisor search eventually narrowed to Buckhead, and the Wingate ultimately chosen.SHORT VERSION: Well appointed 3-star hotel with clean rooms and great amenities for price, but could tweak food offerings and customer service. LONG VERSION:Booking and contacting the hotel was easy, and Chris answered all of my questions and seamlessly arranged for our airport pick-up (our driver was Ben who was great).The rooms/amenities were true to the hotel's website.While there are other reviews nit-picking about the wear-and-tear in the room, these in my opinion were minor, expected for a 15 year-old property & did not lessen my overall impression of the room. Also, it would be unfair for persons to complain about the dated decor when they would have known that in advance by going to the website.The room was virtually spotless & all of the appliances were clean/functional. Housekeeping staff were helpful and courteous. There was an issue with the in-room safe which was quickly addressed. In the bathroom there was an adjustable showerhead and the usual toiletries. Towels were clean.The air-conditioning controls took a while to adjust & the unit itself was a bit loud, but it provided good white noise for sleep. The beds were comfortable but the pillows quickly lost their shape & once or twice I had neck stiffness when I woke up.Breakfast was the same every single day. The selection was really varied though, with scrambled eggs, sausage, grits, oatmeal, cereal, bagels/muffins, biscuits, hot/cold beverages (including latte) & waffles and omelets made to order. At times the muffins were being rationed & the bacon strips appeared to be deep fried/re-fried. The highlight during my breakfasts there was the opportunity to meet FM, who made a great omelet & his charisma underscored his value to this property.We accessed the limo frequently (great ride!). Workers were very professional, but we were disappointed that nothing special was done for my mother on her birthday despite being made aware of it, and over the 5 days we were there, it felt as if we were wearing out our welcome.We spent most of our days out though, & while a ride was needed to the MARTA station, the system was easy to use to access other districts in Atlanta. Eateries and a shopping centre were all within walking distance from the hotel.Overall, I would stay here again on a future trip to Atlanta. \n",

      "  Review : We were in Atlanta to visit Emory Clinic, and needed a place that was not full of the fragrances used in most hotels. We found this gem of a place! Hard wood floors, windows that open, and a staff that was not only kind and willing to work with me, but also presented us with a room that was clean and not reeking of chemicals and deodorizers. In addition, their breakfast each morning (included in the fee for the room) was made fresh, and they were able to make a omelet for me that was dairy-free. The staff was kind, meticulous, and communicative. This is a gem of a place, and if I return to Atlanta, this hotel is a sure bet. \n",

I gave it a fourth star for the nice extras: wood floor in the room (far cleaner, in my opinion, and a great idea); excellent customer service at front desk and breakfast; limo service to local restaurants; and a very good, free, hot breakfast (including an actual chef to make your waffles, rather than the awful do-it-yourself variety). Very nice option when traveling with kids!\n",

Happy to report this hotel is still a winner.We stayed in room 517 (overlooking the pool/parking lot--the \"quiet\" side of the hotel), with 2 double beds. The good:-super comfy beds-spacious room with big window-very quiet (and I'm a light sleeper)-friendly, helpful staff-unbelievably wonderful breakfast! The best grits I've ever had, omelets made to order, bacon and sausage patties, scrambled eggs,biscuits and gravy, cereal, fruit, a cafe latte/capucino machine.-free parkingThe not so good:-bathroom not huge but there's a long vanity to put toiletries, and the shower is very good.I highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again if I'm in the area.\n",

      "  Review : My wife and I spent three nights at the Wingate recently, two of which were very enjoyable in a nice, clean, spacious room. However one night was an unprecedented disaster with little sleep and multiple trips to the front desk as I pleaded with them to resolve (what sounded to me like) a dangerous fight between a couple in the adjoining room. The argument started at 12:30am with raised voices and objects being thrown against the wall, and ended at 2:30am with the lady of the couple leaving. We could hear every word for those two hours, including front desk attempts to break up the fight. After finally getting to sleep we were awakened by the neighbor's almost-cartoon-like snoring at 3:30. Next morning, when the day manager took over, we were moved to another room and our last night's stay was comped.So, despite the great breakfast with made to order omelets, and the free parking and WiFi, there are too many hotel options in Buckhead near this price point for me to return to the Wingate.\n",

      "  Review : This hotel was the site of the business meeting that we were attending, so we chose to stay one night there for convenience. We didn't know what to expect as this hotel, but we were nicely surprised with the rooms: hardwood floors and nice amenities--especially considering the very reasonable rate. The hotel is 5min from the famous Buckhead Diner (same street), and many other dining options. The breakfast is not to skip with the espresso maker and the omelet station. As for the latter, make sure to ask the \"omelet guru\" to tell you his story, it will make your breakfast experience one-of-a-kind! The only negative with this stay was the inflexibility for a late checkout time. As the business meeting was ongoing at that time, it would really have helped to get a late checkout. And while we understand that the hotel was full, 11am seemed a bit earlier compared to other places we stayed.But overall, it didn't change our opinion that this hotel was a great stay, and its location was very convenient to many places we wanted to go. With its complimentary internet and parking, its rate was simply very attractive. We would stay there again if we needed a place to stay in Buckhead.\n",

This event went remarkably well, thanks in large part to the excellent service and accommodations we received from while at the Wingate by Wyndham Buckhead. Property owners Freny and Burges and the entire hotel staff worked very hard to ensure that the event progressed seamlessly and that the experience was exceptional. From the early menu planning stages to the pre-meeting A/V run-through through the networking reception that followed the meeting, I felt we were in very capable, caring hands. Personally, I found it refreshing that my room had hard wood floors with rugs rather than wall-to-wall carpeting: it made me feel like I was staying at somebody's home! The hotel's complimentary Lincoln Navigator stretch limousine service was also a great perk.\n",

The rooms are very loud when people enter the hotel at night and in the morning when they served breakfast we would be awoken to crashing plates/dishes. The room was nice, decor wise with mini fridge, microwave etc. There was a large TV in the room with a lot of HBO channels for movies etc. The bed was comfortable, however, was not bolted into the wall, so if you leaned on it, it slid around.

      "  Review : The hotel staff was extremely nice but we had issues when checking in. The hotel is known to be one of the cleanest in the area (so we're told) but there was hair in the bed when we checked in the rooms (cleaning staff needs to wear something to cover their heads - after one night I discovered why their was loose hair in the bath room and in the beds...it's from the cleaning staff as they are cleaning...this happened right after they cleaned our room after the first night we noticed again random loose hair in the bed and on the floors). The place needs updating. The lock in the first room broke from the wall. Scratched/chipped hard wood floors and rocky beds that are not mounted to the wall. Some may like it but for me my standards are a bit higher.\n",

It is a hidden jewel hotel in the Buckhead area.

However, the beds are terrible. I barely slept the first night and woke up with serious back aches. I dreaded the second night. Also, breakfast was very disappointed. For someone used to eating fresh and whole foods, it did not meet my needs nor expectations. One of the two apples available was even rotten. \n",

      "  Review : I recently stayed 3 nights in a two queen bed room on the fourth floor. The hotel is small, quiet, and very clean. The room had hardwood floors, a granite/tile bathroom, a flat screen TV, faux-empire style furniture, and VERY comfortable beds (Simmons mattresses) with beautiful linens. I found zero evidence of any creepy-crawlies (I examine every hotel room fastidiously before even unloading my suitcases from the bellhop cart). I had the best sleep I can recall ever having away from home. The breakfast buffet served in the lobby offers something for everyone. There is dry cereal, yogurt, bacon, sausages, biscuits, eggs, and Belgian waffles along with juice, milk, and coffee. Breakfast is served until 10:00am, which is perfect for late-risers like me. I found all the staff members I interacted with to be very friendly, helpful, and competent. A friend traveling with me said the only exception was the bartender. She was friendly, but was very slow, had to look up recipes to make common drinks (like a margarita), and put in the wrong ingredients when making some drinks. Maybe she was pinch-hitting for the regular bartender?The parking lot is small, but we never had any difficulty finding a spot even when not returning to the hotel until 10:00pm or later. I would definitely stay in this hotel again when visiting Atlanta. It's in a great location to hit Buckhead and Roswell shopping areas and is about 20-25 minute drive to downtown (depending on traffic).\n",

      "  Review : If you need to stay in Atlanta, don't stay downtown, book into this hotel in Buckhead (a nicer district in the North of the city).The rooms are large and well appointed and a VG breakfast is thrown in. Best of all are the staff - they are all very helpful and pleasant and really make you feel welcome (unusual for city hotels).They also have a stretch limo for the free use of customers (I used it all the time). It will take you anywhere within a three mile radius which covers the Lenox Rd mall, the train station and a host of great restaurants.Say hello to the elderly gentleman who makes the omelletes for breakfast. He's over 80 but he's a grand chap and has got lots of stories. Ask him about his authentic Scottish attire (kilt, sporran - the works).Frankly if I go back to Atlanta I wouldn't dream of stopping anywhere else.\n",

      "  Review : Planned a weekend with the family in Atlanta. I chose Wingate by Wyndham for the location and all the extras you got without being charged extra. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Cookies at the desk were a treat at anytime of the day or night. Our room was very spacious and temperature was always comfortable. Beds slept great. They have foot warmer throws on the bed. Thanks to heavy blackout curtains you didn't wake with the sun. Room had a mini fridge and microwave. Bathroom had marble vanity and full size tub. The shower head was Fantastic. Never wanted to get out of shower. Had great pressure. Plenty of towels. Work out room had modern equipment with a TV. Pool and hot tub outside very clean. Always had water,coffee,tea in lobby. My daughter and I would go down before bed and have hot chocolate and cookies. The breakfast was amazing!! Wifi worked great. I had an omelette the first day and waffles the next. They had a full spread of food. Took the limo the first night out for dinner. Kids loved the ride. Felt secure at all times. Cameras all around the outside. Free parking, wifi, breakfast.Could go on and on! Will stay there again! \n",

The hotel offers a complimentary limo to drive you anywhere w/in a 3 mile radius, just tip the driver. :) The front desk staff was super friendly and offered to help us with finding last minute reservations for somewhere to eat. The room was spacious and clean, the pillows were 4 small pillows instead of 2 regular sized ones, which was okay; but I didn't love that. I felt like the King bed was very high with low ceilings, but that is a personal preference and not really a negative of the quality of the hotel. I love that parking, WiFi, and a great breakfast were included as part of the hotel rate. We would definitely stay here again!\n",

I can confidently say...The hotel works hard to earn a customers loyalty & they've got ours. The only glitch was inability to use the Wi-Fi due to poor coverage in our room, but we had a laptop & the LAN connection was perfect. Marquis received us on our first day & gave us a timely check in...for us, it meant a lot cause our toddler was tired (we had a bad experience at a hotel in UAE once). The staff were magnificent...Ms T & our little boy fell in love, & the rest as they say...is history. We loved it & will visit again when in ATL.

Highlights were staff friendliness and nice breakfast. The property is in a nice area and the hotel was relatively quiet. The hotel offers a free limo within 3 miles of the property. On the negative side, mattress was sunken in and room had wear and tear that the hotel should have kept up with (tile, toilet, clothes closet). We could hear people in the adjoining room though, so we were not very impressed with the level of privacy.\n",

      "  Review : I visited the Atlanta area for a wedding and decided to stay in Buckhead for a couple of days. The hotel is in a convenient location. As I had not hired a car the hotel's car service was indispensable for me to access local places as well as the MARTA station so that I could get Downtown easily. Staff are helpful and pleasant. I stayed in a room with a King bed, which I would say was a good size room for a single person. The room was nice. The omelette to order at breakfast was nice. Breakfast could be improved by considering the health conscious and providing a fresh fruit mix (though there were apples and bananas) and plain yoghurts. Overall it was a very nice stay and I would recommend this hotel and definitely stay at the Wyndham Buckhead again.\n",

We usually stay at much higher priced hotels but all of the hotels near by had lower ratings than this property. We will stay at the Wingate every time we are in that part of Atlanta!\n",

      "  Review : We spent last weekend here for a family wedding weekend and were very pleased with every aspect of our stay. We were picked up at the airport by a limo arranged by the hotel........The driver Benny turned out to be one of the most extraordinary and articulate people I have ever met, and I will always remember the content of our conversation. The accommodations were clean and comfortable, and we started our days with a great breakfast highlighted by a custom omelette created by a former executive chef, F.M., as he calls himself, a true gentleman and omelette connoisseur! In addition, my daughter was traveling with her 3 mo.old baby, and when she realized she had left a special baby dress in the closet, they offered to mail it back to her! Only negative, the hardware and locks to the guest room doors are very noisy.\n",

But the lunch and dinner menu is sad. They don't even offer a salad of any sort, not even with the one pasta dish offered. There are great places to walk to and eat within blocks like Tin Lizzys and Zoe's Kitchen. The rooms are very comfortable with hard wood floors, comfy linens and enough room to move around. \n",

      "  Review : My friend and I only stayed one night, but we had a pleasant experience. The staff was very friendly. The breakfast looked good, but we took the opportunity to walk down to the Flying Biscuit, so we did not partake of the free breakfast. The room and bathroom were clean. The room needs some maintenance. The bathroom door was very difficult to close fully. It was too tight and rubbing the frame. The floor in the main room is a wood laminate, which I am sure looked great when new. But now it shows quite a bit of wear. Quite a few of the boards are lifting on the ends and starting to curl upward. I don't know if other rooms show the same signs of wear or not. All in all, I had a pleasant stay and due to the friendliness of the staff and cleanliness of the room, I would stay again.\n",

My only problem is the breakfast wasn’t what I had expected. I stayed many places and I normally stay at hotels where the breakfast is included that why I don’t mind paying more. But I was disappointed with the selections and the service each night I had to look for someone to help or ask questions. I requested water and one would think I ask them for the world. Other than that the front desk staff was very friendly. I didn’t get a chance to use the Limo because each time I requested it the wait was long so we opted to drive.\n",

Within 2 minutes, the driver was ready to take me in the stretch SUV limo! I felt so fancy! They also offered to take me in the limo to dinner later that night, but I ordered in instead.

Great location in Buckhead - convenient to shopping and dining. Love that I can walk out the door and take a good safe walk on the sidewalks and in nice neighborhoods proximate to the Wingate. The free breakfast offerings are outstanding- great made to order omelets or eggs (egg whites too.) Lemon and lime infused water in the lobby during the day. Friendly staff all around, including the convenient bar. Hard to beat for the price point and quality of the rooms and service. Did not need to use the free transportation, but the big stretch limos were available for trips in a 3 mile radius. YOu will not be disappointed.\n",

      "  Review : I stayed here during Labor Day weekend while I attended the Dragon Con. The hotel looks nice on the outside and had some nice amenities but my stay was ruined by the staff. I checked in early Saturday morning around 1:00 am since I had been out at Dragon Con. I had sweated throughout the day and ended going to sleep without showering.I returned late Saturday morning/Sunday night to find the room had not been cleaned at all. The dirty towels, pillows, etc were in the exact same spot I left them in. When I went to the front counter, the receptionist told me that \"he thinks I left my do not disturb sign on my door.\" (I clearly remembered taking it down before I left for the day). The guy never even once offered to get a quick clean up or anything; he just said he would \"follow up\" on it and gave me some towels. The next morning I went to the front desk to see if anything had been done about it and the receptionist there acted like he didn't know anything about it. I had to interrogate him about it and he finally found where it had been written on a clipboard shoved into a corner. He gave me a fake reassurance that something would be done. I never heard anything from them. Skip this place, it just isn't worth it. For the money I paid, I would like to have my room cleaned between days and more importantly have staff who actually give a flip that customers are having a bad experience. Just don't do it!!!\n",

We were met by Monique who was an absolute pleasure to deal with during our entire stay. We also had interactions with Marie on the night shift and Craig the Limo driver. All were very professional and a pleasure to deal with. All were very welcoming...The room was clean and more than adequate with a very nice King Bed, small refrigerator and microwave along with a coffee maker. The free breakfast buffet was excellent .. it had a choice of fresh fruit and additional healthy items to choose from..along with our freshly made omelets which were exceptional. This hotel does not charge for parking as others in the area charge $20.00 and $ 30.00 a night. We highly recommend this hotel as a great hotel and value in the Atlanta Buckhead area. We will definitely be back !Ron and Kathy F\n",

The location was perfect! 1 mile from the event we were attending and .2 miles from a spectacular restaurant (Flip Burger Boutique). The staff were all very courteous from beginning to end. I only wish we had at least 1 more day to enjoy all they had to offer! The bar area seemed very nice as well as the pool area. The breakfast served in the morning was fantastic and offered something for everyone. They offer complimentary lemo service within a 3 mile radius too! The room itself was VERY clean and spacious (Standard King Room). Will definitely stay here again when visiting family!Tip: Ice machine is only located on 5th floor!\n",

The front desk staff (Monique, Chris, Marquise and Marie) are amazing and always make me feel like family. The rooms are comfortable and clean and I always have enough space. The hotel is located close to many restaurants and stores. They have a fantastic breakfast each morning that I suggest taking advantage of and a refreshing pool to enjoy in free time!

Particularly I would like to mention Marie who was on the front desk and for whom nothing was too much trouble - thank you. The pool was nice although you did need to ask for towels fro the front desk. The big plus for us was the free limo. The boys loved just driving around and we appreciated being rescued from a local restaurant on evening when the heavens opened by the helpful limo and its driver. Breakfast was plentiful and varied.

      "  Review : Great check in experience, very friendly and professional staff. Room was large and the furniture is fairly new. Rug and Laminate flooring, don't see that in a hotel everyday. The air worked well but the rapidly changing weather outside seemed to fake out the compressor, still seemed humid. Was a very hot afternoon and then a thunderstorm rolled in and dropped the outside temperature. It is August in Atlanta, whatcha gonna do? Stayed here because the rates are much better than the so called upscale hotels in Buckhead, free parking and the free shuttle. Try getting that at the Ritz Carlton. Free WiFi and cooked to order breakfast.Girlfriend and I were attending a Charity event and she took a nap before we got dressed, I went to the car and to use the business center for a few minutes. She was awakened by a presence touching her and I was not in the room. Later that night I woke up to use the restroom and felt the presence in the room myself that time. It didn't try to frighten either of us. All the free amentites and a ghost, all for the best rates in town.\n",

The only drawback for me was the location after you exit off. It's a little confusing because of the one way street. But - other than that it was a great place to stay.

      "  Review : This hotel was chosen because of the great reviews it got on TripAdvisor and because of the great rates they offer. We stayed here for two nights on a visit to Atlanta to sightsee and visit family. While there are positive aspects to the hotel, I cannot echo the reviews of others.I cannot dispute that the hotel is good value in the area, especially during the week. The free parking, breakfast, pool, wifi, etc. are nice perks and make a difference. The beds are comfortable. Rooms are spacious and well lit. Staff are exceptionally friendly. More on that later.The rooms have an odd layout. We were in a king room. These rooms have a decent bathroom, and then what appears to a room, with one armchair, desk and then a rug with lots of space. The TV sits on a dresser near the bed. The bed, luggage stand, dresser are all crowded into the second part of the room right beside the heating/cooling system. There is not even enough space for a night stand on one side of the bed (although there is a lamp). The person sleeping on that side has the unit blowing on them all night. This definitely affects sleep quality.To be specific, we were given room 530 when we arrived (requested high floor, quiet room and therefore this number). The young man to checked us in was very pleasant and accommodating. The room smelled musty from the vent, but we ignored this and went to dinner -- assuming it would dissipate over time. It didn't. After a sleepless and unpleasant night with moldy odor, we asked for a room change and were ready to go to another hotel. Monique was very helpful and gave us the option of two rooms, which we checked first. Both of these seemed ok. So we were moved to another room, which was much better. Same layout -- better bathroom, by the way. However, the lingering mold smell was still present to a lesser degree over time. I do think that Wingate should think about their room configuration and do some major work on their ventilation system. With everything else going for them -- good location, lots of parking, superb staff. Room layout and a feeling of cleanliness and well being can have a significant impact.\n",

      "  Review : The customer service sucks at this hotel. I called 1-800-337-0070 around 1230a.m. CST this morning and spoke to Lulu who guranteed that I would have a hotel room for check in Sunday morning at 1a.m. Lulu was rude and became aggravated on the call because I confirmed my reservations with her multiple times. I wanted to be sure that she understood my request especially with the loud background noise in her area and her accent. After speaking with her, I called the hotel at 404-869-1100 and spoke with a gentleman who confirmed my reservation as well. Because I wanted to be sure that all was ok at the hotel prior to traveling, I called the hotel again this morning around 10a.m. CST and spoke with a different gentleman and was informed that I wouldn't have a room and my last name was misspelled in their system. This was very frustrating after spending wasted time earlier with two reps who provided me incorrect information. So, I then call the 800# back and was transferred to Mary #7681 who also had poor customer service and a very smart mouth with rude comments. I asked to speak with upper management, but was informed that one wasn't available, but she would file my complaint. She also stated that a manager would call me back by August 21st.......really, it would take almost a month fora manager to call me back???!!!!!!!! I hate dealing with a company who hires FOOLS to represent them.....I hate poor customer service! Be aware, spend your money elsewhere because everyone deserves to be treated decently. I am so glad that I followed my mind to confirm my stay prior to leaving out of town because I would've been stuck with 2 young kids trying to find a hotel in the early a.m. I strongly suggest that you triple check your reservations if you decide to go here. Good luck!\n",

It is a good value with free parking and a very good breakfast offering complete with custom omelets.We have stayed here before and will, no doubt, again. Having said that I do have to say there were a few issues on this stay. The floor in our room was buckled near the window. We soon found the reason when a thunderstorm caused rain to drip fro the ceiling. Apparently, the the housekeeping staff was shorthanded because housekeeper didn't come to make-up our room till 4:30 while we were dressing for a wedding. I am sure these were just glitches but worth taking note of. Despite these issues we recommend this property.\n",

      "  Review : Although the rooms facing the street are noisy at high-traffic periods, this is an extremely comfortable and well-kept hotel. The staff are exceptionally friendly and the morning breakfast buffet is a cut above. They seem not to take the minimalist approach to lower-priced accommodations of their peers in Buckhead. Unless you are turning with the traffic out of the parking lot, getting across Piedmont can take a LONG time. So, turn down the bed, turn up the fan and enjoy yourself\n",

      "  Review : Looked for a hotel near Chastain Park, GA to attend an outdoor concert and the Wingate looked close. From the moment my wife and I walked through the door we knew we had picked the right place. The from desk was very welcoming and greeted us with a smile. We had the one bedroom suite with the spa tub, a kitchen fink, fridge and microwave. The room was clean and looked fantastic. It had hardwood floors though out and had a very large bathroom with spa tub and separate shower. The bed slept very comfortable. We really appreciated the complimentary ride to Chastain Park. Great Job Wingate.\n",

The rate was reasonable. There was an excellent free breakfast in the morning and the hotel has a free shuttle that will take you anywhere within a 3 mile radius (which means you can ride to Chastain Park Amphitheatre and avoid the concert parking hassles.\n",

      "  Review : We took an overnight trip to Atlanta, not really knowing what we were doing, and picked this place since it was popular on TripAdvisor and not too pricey. The plan was that my wife and mother-in-law would go to Lenox Square mall, which worked out great - free limo ride from the hotel, and that my father-in-law, stepson, and I would go to the baseball game, which also worked out but it was a terrible traffic mess getting there. The rooms were fine, although the ceiling was coming unraveled over the shower in ours, which is a little unsettling. The breakfast and the pool were great. The location I would say now having been there best for Buckhead area destinations, although if we had been there without my father-in-law whose mobility is limited we might have taken the MARTA downtown for the game and walked from there and avoided the traffic that way. After the Braves' game, late, I walked from the hotel to the Tin Lizzy taco bar which is open late with a late night menu and was a good place to sit outside and relax, it is more or less within sight of the hotel and across the street. The hotel is just enough outside of the denser parts of Buckhead that you can drive up the street to get gas or necessities from the drug store or some sandwiches within a half mile but in some parts of the day it is difficult even to get that far without a lot of patience, all of which I guess is merely a fact of life in the big city and not a criticism of the hotel.\n",

Outdoor pool very nice too! Mexican restaurant just a few blocks away was great also (Tin Lizzy's) and within walking distance.\n",

The hotel lobby and rooms were very clean. The noise was minimal. The pool was in excellent condition. The breakfast was outstanding. The gentleman manning the omelet/waffle station was extremely nice. The location of the hotel is perfect. Minimal traffic and very close to restaurants and shopping. We loved the Lennox Square area which is only a mile away. The walk to the Peachtree Road race was short and scenic. Absolutely loved the limo/shuttle service. The driver was extremely nice and patient. This has to be one of the best stays at a hotel that we've had. We'll be back next 4th of July.\n",

      "  Review : This hotel is idea for a stay close to the Chastain Park Amphitheater. The hotel provides a complimentary stretch limo to and from the concert venue. My only complaint about this service is that the limo driver may have to make more than one trip if there are too many guests. I wish they would allow guests to make a reservation for a specific time instead of having all the guests show up at once to board the limo. Those that don't make it on the first run will have to wait 20-30 minutes for the driver to return for the next load. The hotel itself is very clean. We noticed a dampness to the room even with the air turned way down to alleviate it. The rooms are large and the beds are quite comfortable. The complimentary hot breakfast was quite nice and the breakfast area was large. It was very warm in this area though and would be nice if management could cool this area better.The staff were courteous, but I would not say overly friendly. I don't think any of the desk staff ever smiled! Overall, it was a nice stay and I would stay here again.\n",

      "  Review : Stayed here for the July 4th 10K Road Race that starts at Lenox & Peachtree Road. Excellent property, nice clean rooms - excellent staff - and by far the best free Hotel breakfast ever (real bacon...not fake, real omlettes). If you arrive late, and the hotel is booked, expect no parking to be available.....but, there are plenty of curbs (but it get's really tight). You can walk to Buckhead and MARTA (but, hotel provides a shuttle as well). Just be aware that traffic on Piedmont is HORRIBLE (not hotels fault) - just be aware that evening traffic will cause the 1.1 mile trip to the Phipps (Buckhead) Mall to take 20++ minutes.For racers - skip the other more expensive hotels that charge you an arm and a leg for everything from parking to wifi - and stay here! Free wifi, free parking, free breakfast and reasonable rates! Short walk to the starting line area, and short return walk from Marta after the race.\n",

The Wingate room was large, quiet, very reasonably priced and the customer service was fabulous. It was a 10-15 minute drive to most of the tourist sights and the Buckhead area was wonderful. Beautiful homes and estates within a few miles and many great restaurants. Also near two big shopping areas. We had wonderful breakfast with made to order omelets, which were included in price in addition to free parking. They also have a car service which takes you to local restaurants. We were there for 4 nites. It is also convenient to the airport. HIghly recommend.\n",

      "  Review : My family stayed here for 4 nights & agree with many of the other reviews--it's a great hotel. Staff is friendly & helpful, rooms are clean & large, breakfast each morning was fantastic (grits were my favorite!), the limo is a treat, & the pool area is so nice. I'd happily stay there again. The rooms also have a refrigerator & microwave, which we always try to find when traveling. Our king bed was very comfortable but as others have mentioned, I wish they had 2 queens instead of 2 doubles. We brought along our own blow up bed for our child. The rooms do have lots of lighting & a very large window--loved that! I also loved how the hotel keeps ice water out all day down in the lobby; a nice touch!There are a few minor things I'll mention, but these are not bad by any means. The bathroom in our room was small. If one person was in the tub/shower, someone else could use the sink area, but that was about the only time 2 people could be there at the same time. If your room faces Piedmont Road, you will hear road noise sometimes. I also will mention that I wish this hotel (& any hotels with pools) would install retractable clothes lines over their tubs. There really was no good space in the bathroom to hang up wet swimsuits so other things sometimes got wet.One other issue, for me, is that smoking is allowed around the pool area. I'm getting used to staying in hotels where smoking is only allowed in very small areas that are generally away from spots where people tend to be. We were at the pool frequently & just prefer to be in smoke free areas.\n",

      "  Review : We stayed at the Wingate before our trip to Colorado, we had a pretty early flight and we were worried that we may miss our plane because the shuttle service didn't start until 7 a.m. The shuttle bus driver actually took us 10 min early and got us there sooo fast we couldn't believe how well he drove. Now, about the hotel, the room was pretty small, but very clean and neat. The one bad thing I can say is that the TV looked to be from the 90's, but it worked. There were no coke or snack machines or ice machine on the 4th floor, where we stayed, but they did have a little shop down stairs full of goodies. I actually left my computer charger in the room, when I called they found it and held it for me until I came back from Colorado. We will stay here again.\n",

The hotel was clean (rooms and all surrounding areas) and the free breakfast was amazing! To have someone making your omelette to order each and every morning was amazing. The entire offering at breakfast was great and everyone (adults, kids) would find something that they liked. The front desk staff was friendly and extremely helpful - while we didn't need to take advantage of the \"free\" limousine service from the hotel, I did check the limos out and both limos were amazing! I was tempted to just request one to ride around in it. :) If you haven't checked out this hotel - you need to - hotel, amenities - top notch!\n",

The front desk clerk was very friendly. I had originally booked two doubles but I ask to see the room before we occupied and it wasn't going to be room, so they let me upgrade to a business suite. Some things could use some improvement. The place is 14 years old. I would recommend quieter air units, longer shower curtains, and updates in the bathroom, a fan is definitely need! Also housekeeping could do a better job on their cleaning abilities as well. A roll of paper towels or kitchen towel would be great for the sink/dining area. The pool was clean and the hot tub was great! I loved the breakfast they had every morning. It's a full breakfast with fresh made waffles and omelets, very good!\n",

      "  Review : Stayed 6/10-6/13. Room was clean and efficient. Free fast internet (wired/wireless) was appreciated, although I had two instances where connection inexplicably dropped off but reconnected in under 5 minutes. The hot breakfast with made-to-order omelets was just icing on the cake. The Business Center had fast PCs, although running WinXP. Free parking, although the lot is a bit on the tight side, especially with a larger vehicle (Suburban). Very close to Lenox Square and decent restaurants within walking distance. All-in-all, a most pleasant stay.\n",

      "  Review : I stayed for three nights in a king executive suite on the third floor facing Piedmont avenue. My room was immaculate, the air conditioning worked beautifully, there was plenty of hot water in the spacious shower, and all of the staff were very pleasant and accommodating. Some reviewers mentioned that Piedmont's traffic noise and the sounds from air conditioner were annoying, but I sleep with \"white noise\" to drown out those kinds of things and I slept soundly in a very comfortable bed (I did bring my own pillow). I also did not hear anyone clomping around on the hardwood floor in the room above me. Wifi worked well after a small glitch upon arrival (which was quickly resolved by calling the 800 number on the desk in the room). The complimentary breakfast (6AM-10AM) was delicious and the limousine (within 3 mile radius) was extremely convenient, especially during Atlanta's horrid evening rush hour. The refrigerator is slightly larger than you might find at competing hotels and it even includes a tiny freezer section. The only improvement I would suggest is to add some type of edging around the blackout shades, because light seeps in from the sides. I'd love to stay here again.\n",

I met two wonderful people, a mother and daughter pair from Ireland that amazingly we had someone we both knew very well. We went to the lobby bar for some wine and after a while the bartender brought us over a new cocktail he made up and wAnted our opinion and to try and name. We came up with hop, skip, and go naked and so it is now the name of this tastefully fruity bubbly drink. You must try one you will not go wrong!!!!!i loved it.\n",

      "  Review : We were staying in Atlanta on our way to New Orleans. The hotel is based in the Buckhead business part of town, which was a bit concerning, but we were very pleasantly surprised at the location, with lots of greenery and a nice up-market neighbourhood. The hotel itself was really well appointed with generous sized room and a great little swimming pool. There was a complimentary stretch limo at our disposal for drop-off and pick-up within a 3 mile radius until 11:00pm. Breakfast was supervised by a chef who cooked fantastic omelettes and waffles to order, whilst also keeping the restaurant area in pristine condition. The front desk was also manned by friendly and very helpful staff. The only slight niggle was when we ordered food - they cooked it in the kitchens, but they didn't deliver to our room - I had to go down to collect it! Overall, we had a great stay, leaving wishing we could have stayed longer.\n",

This was our second time to stay at this hotel and we just love the casual welcoming feel of the place. The lobby and the rooms are warm and welcoming, instead of cold and commercial like a lot of hotels these days. It feels like a home instead of a hotel. The breakfast is incredible and we love that they have so much to choose from! (omelettes, cereal, yogurt, bacon, sausage, biscuits, waffles, grits, oatmeal, fresh fruit....etc.)\n",

      "  Review : \"There was a little girl, with a little curl right in the middle of her forehead. When she was good, she was very, very good, but when she was bad, she was horrid!\" That's how I would describe Monique, a customer service representative who worked at the front desk during the day. A situation arose where I and my mother wanted to be added to the rewards point system. After enjoying a WONDERFUL evening in Buckhead, we walked to the front desk because we both wanted to register. The night representative, Allen, who was very sweet and kind, took both of our information. He didn't know how to register both of us, especially since the room was in my name. However, we did complete the registration form. The next morning, I awoke to a note under our hotel room door. On the note, my mother's name was on the note as being registered. I booked the room. My mother and I went to Monique at the front desk to let her know what happened (At this point, I didn't know her name, but I DID FIND OUT). She spoke to me and my mother like we were the problem, like we were dumb and ignorant. She was very loud. As we were explaining to her what happened, she proceeded to tell us what we read on the note. How can she possibly know what's on the note when she didn't even leave a note for us? Allen left the note. She didn't let my mother and I get a word in. The conversation was cut short and we left. I didn't show my anger at the hotel. However, I was VERY upset. As I walked to the car I stated that I didn't like her, which I rarely say of another person. She has a \"STUCK UP, KNOW IT ALL and YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING\" attitude. She then had the audacity to call me after we left to ask about my reservation. Little did I know, that was the same girl who helped with my reservation the week before. She was very nice on the phone, a totally different person. Ergo,\" the little girl with the little curl.\" She is a wolf in sheep's clothing. I never write reviews, but she drove me to that point. She need to work the night shift. The day shift need someone who is friendly and professional at all times. She does not represent the company, nor the management well at all. Now Allen, he is who the company and management should promote. He represents the business VERY well. Allen should work the day shift. Allen was the most enjoyable person to talk with. He is personable and very helpful. He even told us what to do in Buckhead since this was my mom's first time to the area. We mentioned to him that we only saw Lenox Mall and we wanted to visit the other mall, but we didn't know where it was. He told us to take advantage of the limo service to take us to Phipps Plaza. We also wanted to look at homes. He told us exactly were to go. He was so professional, yet personable. He also took the time to help me in the business center. He suggested that we use all of the amenities, such as the pool and the fitness center. He was also the reason that we stayed an extra night. That's the type of personality an out of towner want to do business with, not a loud know it all. Geesh!!! I hated that I had to book the limo through her the next morning. I wanted to avoid her at all cost. I stated that we went to Lenox Mall and we wanted to go to the other mall. I couldn't remember the name of the mall. She stated the name of the mall with that same STUCK UP attitude of, \"I KNOW ALL THINGS AND YOU DON'T!\" Gee Whiz!! However, the hotel itself was absolutely beautiful and comfortable. The property is in a WONDERFUL location. The hardwood floors were a nice touch. They have a full breakfast, grits, eggs, bacon...you name it, they had it. The Limo service was awesome! They both were very personable and professional. I would definitely stay at this property again as long as Monique is off for a couple of days or on a long vacation. I have never in my life ran into someone like her. However, as I stated before, the property and location is WONDERFUL!!! All that you receive for the price of the hotel, you can't beat it!! A FREE Limo ride?? Who does that? WINGATE BY WYNDHAM - BUCKEAD DOES!! I LOVED IT!!! I would have given this location an \"Overall Rating of Excellent,\" but that major customer service flaw dropped the rating for me....so sad! Because of Allen and the hotel itself, I am giving a service and overall rating of \"Very Good.\"\n",

      "  Review : Over all I had an average stay, because there were bumps in the road. One of the desk clerks were SO rude, I had to file a written complaint. She talks nice on the phone, and then turns into something crazy, and then documented that I was confused, and it was clear that she was, she backed down, when my daughter intervened, it is clear that she needs to be retrained. She wants to tell me what I read, as if i did not know what I was talking about. She takes away from the honor of the hotel. One of the desk clerks, Allen, was awesome. He was SO personable. He treated us like family, and was still so professional. My last day, the breakfast cook, after being SO nice, turned into something crazy. He added hot pepper to my omelet, after I stood there, and told him, what i wanted in it. He became SO defensive in front of the lady supervisor, and tore into me after she walked off. He began to fix the food wrong, while telling me, that what I did was disgusting. He began fixing it with egg white, and as i was correcting him, he poured egg over the egg white, I refused for it to be fixed that way, and he still would not fix my egg the way that I asked him too. They need camera, so they can see how some of there employees treat their customers. The two rudest people, started off treating us SO nice. The rude cook, began talking to me kindly with no apology. The mean lady clerk, continued treating us kindly, again no apology. I had to report to the night desk person the fact that my floor was dirty. the last night, my room did not have a pen, and pad, and after the second night we did not have, a resupply of the dirty cloths bag that was suppose to be replenished in the closet. I expected so much more, rude people in a nice environment, does not match. I should say, that they need more professional employees like Allen, and some of the wonderful people, that I met that were so professional, and match with the beautiful room etc. Over, all I was shocked, and very, uncomfortable with these encounters, especially with so many good people out there, that would take their employees business more seriously, yes retraining is in order. I thought I was being charged one price, and the taxes were shocking.\n",

      "  Review : We stayed for a few days at the Wingate, and overall we were impressed. The bed was very comfortable, the hotel was clean and quiet (we heard little road noise and nothing from the other rooms), and the breakfast was really first rate (the waffles and made-to-order omelets were excellent, and there were other choices as well). The one glitch was the a/c unit: it's one of those units that runs alongside the window (as opposed to being central a/c), and it was noisy. When the a/c's fan was running (which was all the time), it was okay, and once the cooling aspect kicked on, it wasn't too bad, but the sound of the cooling aspect turning on and off was hard to sleep through when it happened almost every minute. Maintenance came and said there was nothing they could do, but at checkout the desk person thought there was a way to set the cooling aspect to stay on permanently, rather than having it operate off the temperature sensor. That would have been helpful.\n",

The property is always fresh, the rooms appointed well, the breakfast food and wonderful cappuccino machine top notch. But the greatest asset this hotel has is the staff. There has been almost no turnover for the past seven years, and why would there be with the excellent care and camaraderie between staff and with visitors. Mr. Moore makes breakfast like home; Craig is so much more than a limo driver. Alan, Chris, Marquis, and Monique know you by name and warmly welcome you. This place is the best choice for relaxing or business in the Buckhead and north Atlanta area.\n",

      "  Review : TA reviews led us to this property. We were looking for the closest hotel to Chastain Park Amphitheatre to attend a concert (Jimmy Buffet). The mention of shuttle service was a draw. That is a huge understatement. The limo is a max-stretch SUV. We arrived at 3 and were looking for a mid afternoon lunch/dinner. When we asked the front desk (very friendly and helpful) about The Ketch she picked up the phone and we were promptly led to the limo. Farris delivered us and picked us up - no hassle, no fuss. When we checked in she (I wish I could remember her name because she was very nice) asked if we were there for the concert. She said there would be 2 limos for the concert and the first would leave at 6:30 and would return to pick us up after the concert. We got on the first limo - 12-14 people. We were driven right up to Gate 2. We were told to meet there after the concert and they would rotate back and forth until everyone was returned. The driver gave everyone a cad with their cell phone if needed. We did as told. We got on the 2nd limo and were promptly returned to the hotel. I cannot imagine a better way to attend a concert at Chastain. Concert goers gathered in the bar before and after. Otherwise the hotel is good. Everyone friendly, room ok, yes hardwood floors, yes omelet bar at breakfast. We had no issues with noise, etc. Bar closed at 11 PM - should have stayed open longer on concert night. My GPS got us there but took us through miles of residential - check alternate routes. No valet but seemingly adequate parking. I cannot overstate how great the limo service is.\n",

We stayed in the One King Bed Suite with a LARGE jacuzzi tub. This suite was great as it had a separate sitting/living room dining room area. The jacuzzi tub was large and didn't take long too fill, I just added a few to many capfuls of bubbles, but it worked out. The shower is large and comfortably the both of us. The room had a refrigerator and microwave. We ordered take out a local restaurant before we arrived, so we never had to leave the room. It was a great stay and we truly enjoyed our anniversary.

      "  Review : I stayed at this hotel this past weekend. I was in town for a concert at the Chastain Park Amphitheater. The hotel lobby was very neat and clean. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet was good. The complimentary limo service was a plus as my friends and I took the limo to go to Chastain. There is a mall and pharmacy within walking distance. This should be disclosed on their website so potential guests know what's nearby. I didn't go into the pool or the fitness center but it looked taken care of. As for the room itself, it had some positives and negatives. The room was very clean. There was a reclining chair in addition to a regular sitting chair, and a computer chair. The AC worked well but I didn't really use it too much. The bathroom was a little bit small but I was alone in my room so it wasn't a big deal. What I didn't like were the beds. The bed wasn't too comfortable and if you were to get on the bed, it would move. I've stayed at different hotels and most of them were connected to the floor but this bed was moveable. The bed was also on the smaller side. If you have 4 people in your party, you'd be very uncomfortable What I also didn't like were the floors. If you were to walk around without your shoes on, you could slip. I almost slipped a few times. But despite the issues with the room, it is a nice hotel.\n",

      "  Review : I must begin by saying that the staff at this hotel is unbelievably friendly. I only live (and have for my whole life) about 2 hours north so I am used to the \"Southern Hospitality\", but this staff goes beyond just being nice. They made it a very welcome place to stay. The check in lady was incredible, and the gentlemen that was on the night shift was able to direct us to a suitable movie venue. I was even able to check show times from the provided business center on a computer. WiFi is available, but having the computer right there was convenient.The included limo service they offer was absolutely fantastic. We took advantage of it all we could and the drivers were fantastic.We stayed in the King Suite with the canopy bed and the room was very pleasant. No complaints at all on that front. The main area and the bedroom both had nice TV's and all amenities were provided. The bed slept wonderful, and the shower was quite nice, better than what you are used to in a hotel. We didn't use the jacuzzi tub, so I can't really speak for it other than it was certainly large enough for two if you wanted to use it.The location of this hotel is excellent for trips to the two main shopping areas close by (Phipps Plaza and Lenox Square). The hotel was easy to get in and out of for us, even during the peek traffic time on Friday afternoon.The breakfast was also phenomenal for a hotel breakfast. There is a chef that cooks omelets to order and terrific Belgian waffles. The only low mark I can possibly place on this hotel is that it is a little pricey. Of course, in this area of Atlanta, most things are pricey. I wasn't looking for the cheapest price when I booked this stay however, I was looking for the best stay, and I feel that I got it. I will certainly remember this place and if I ever decide to stay anywhere near the north end of Atlanta, this will be my first choice.\n",

      "  Review : I called at the last minute (5pm) the night of the Clapton concert (5/3/14) to see if they had rooms open. You could hear that there was a lot going on in the lobby - they were obviously busy - the young lady who took my call made me feel like she had all the time in the world to take care of my questions and to take my reservation. When I arrived a little later, she was at the front desk, and remembered speaking to me. Everyone made me feel welcome, and answered all my questions. My room was gorgeous, and spotless, including the bath. I got the complimentary shuttle to the Clapton show at Chastain Amphitheater, and the driver was great. I have trouble with steps, and he made sure I got in and out of the bus (actually more of a stretch-limo-bus) safely. Everyone was so nice, so courteous - I'll definitely stay there again.\n",

      "  Review : My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at this clean, well appointed hotel during a visit to Atlanta recently. We were in town to attend a music concert at Chastain Park, an outdoor amphitheater nearby. Upon check-in we were pleased to learn about the 24 hour fitness center, well-equipped business center, free full American breakfast, and available in-lobby food and drink (including a bar). But most of all, we were wowed by the offer of a complimentary stretch limousine to take guests to the concert. We were driven to Chastain Park by a very courteous gentleman, Craig, and picked up by the same promptly after the concert. We were, however, embarrassed by the behavior of some of the other guests, who tried to crowd into the limousine unsafely, rather than wait for it to return for them. We understand that the owner of the hotel stayed on the property until every guest had returned from the concert - well after midnight.Our room was clean, comfortable, and well equipped with a desk, sofa, mini fridge, microwave, and a lovely oriental rug on the floor, which was a nice touch.We had asked for a taxi the next morning to take us to the airport. To our surprise, our driver (the director of the transportation department for the hotel) arrived to pick us up in a comfortable, impeccably clean Town Car. The cost for this wonderful service was only $12.00 higher than the regular, dirty cab that we took from the airport.Should we have occasion to visit Atlanta in the future, we will definitely stay here again. Their courteous care of their guests and attention to every detail made our stay a pleasurable experience.\n",

Once I settled down...I was shocked and annoyed to hear a landscaping hedge trimmer making a huge amount of noise. It was 3:00 on a Friday afternoon. He then came inside the pool and started trimming the potted plants. The noise was unbearable so I had to leave. It ruined my afternoon.

      "  Review : We recently stayed at the Wingate in Atlanta/Buckhead and were basically very pleased with the hotel and accommodations except for one detail (and this was Not a Minor detail). The hotel rooms have pull down shades over the windows, however, these shades leave a gap in the side allowing the lights from the streetlights to shine into the room, and across the bed at night AND the morning sun to shine into the room and across the bed. This happened to be my side of the bed. Needless to say, I had light on my face during the night, and in the morning, there was no sleeping in once the sun came up. Framing the these shades with curtains would block the light from coming into the room and across the bed. Other than that, I found the staff (front desk) to be very friendly and helpful, the hotel had a beautiful entrance and the rooms were clean and quiet. While I liked the hotel and would return there for another stay, for me to stay there again, I would need to have better window treatments where light is not steaming across the room.\n",

      "  Review : This was our 3rd stay at Wingate/Buckhead. We find it a great hotel located within a 10 minute drive from family in the area. The service at Wingate has always been stellar. We particularly like the wood floors, the comfort of the beds, the shower water pressure (heavenly after a long drive), and the extensive breakfast offerings which include made-to-order omelets. Having a coffee bar and cappuccino offerings is also one of our favorites.There are just two \"dings\" that are preventing me from giving them a 5-star ranking: (1) the baseboards in the room we stayed in this tine were covered in dust and on our previous stay, the baseboards in the bathroom were dirty as well. A little Clorox cleaner with bleach would also do wonders for the small amounts of mold in the shower and to clean up the grout lines in the bathrooms. (2) We went down for breakfast at 8:10am Sunday morning. The buffet had not been replenished (they had a full house with a couple of groups), so there were no scrambled eggs delivered until AFTER we finished our breakfast, no waffles, 4 biscuits and 1 sausage patty when we went thru the line. The kitchen staff definitely needs to prepare for these types of mornings as most of us who are up and eating breakfast are also looking to eat and get back on the road.One last \"ding:\" The side chair in our room was broken, which we did not notice until our morning of checkout. I sat down in the chair to put on my shoes and the whole chair rocked. I saw that the armrests were broken. Housekeeping needs to be trained to see these types of \"potential accidents\" and get maintenance up to fix broken furnishings. I did report this to the front desk when we left (Room 514).Overall, however, we do enjoy staying at this Wingate and will continue to return on future trips. Just get the \"dust bunny baseboards\" cleaned up -- OK?\n",

      "  Review : You won't find a better place for the price, friendly staff, location, cleanliness, or quality. I have been staying here on business trips for several years. The staff is the best in the business, location is close to lots of places to eat and shopping. The hotel has free parking, free limo within 3 miles, free hot breakfast, free HBO, free Internet, good exercise room. Hotel has been upgraded, nice big flat screens in room and newer lobby area. I really enjoy staying there and you will too. If there is a problem with anything the staff will fix it quick and they truly care about their customers.   \n",

      "  Review : When traveling North from FLA to OH, my husband likes to save money and stay in utilitarian hotels, many of which make me cringe due to poor conditions. We made a great compromise by staying at the Wingate, which gives great value and an elegant night in Atlanta. It's in Buckhead, which is a beautiful, wooded neighborhood of Atlanta. It's easy to reach, a few blocks off the 400. The staff welcome you from the moment you step out of the car. They are the perfect blend of friendly, helpful and efficient. They dispatched us to our room quickly when we wearily walked in the door and clearly just needed to crash, but later when we came asking for dining suggestions they engaged with us very warmly and had us laughing and relaxed.We easily walked a block to find many great restaurants and had great drinks and food that night. The next morning we got directions to a great local park for the morning run/walk - also just blocks away.The room was large and comfortable and very, very clean. Bedding was comfy, bathroom was bright and spotless and the shower pressure was great!Breakfast in the morning was delicious and again, efficient, even though bustling with guests. My husband ordered an omelet and it was made with fine quality ingredients - a sticking point of mine. The fruit salad included tropical fruit like papaya, which I enjoyed, and the biscuits were delish.I can't wait for our next trip south so we can stay here again!\n",

      "  Review : We really enjoyed our stay at Wingate. Check in/out was super easy and fast, the staff was all extremely friendly, and it was overall a great place to stay! It is well-located and convenient to downtown Atlanta which is where we were spending our time. Everywhere we went, we didn't have to go very far. They even have a limo that will take you anywhere within 3 miles for no charge! Pretty neat. We wandered down to the bar one night and enjoyed a fairly reasonably priced drink, and in the morning their breakfast was good! Lots of choices and you could even have the chef make you an omelet or waffle. The only semi-negative thing I could say is that I seemed to hear a lot of surrounding noise from other rooms and in the hallway. I could hear people talking throughout the night and it seemed like they weren't even talking very loudly, just at a normal volume. The doors closing even seemed loud. It didn't interrupt my sleep that badly, just an observation. Overall, we recommend this hotel to others, and we would definitely stay there again!\n",

      "  Review : Me and my wife stayed for two nights in March just to get away in Atlanta. The hotel is located in the middle of Atlanta, fairly close - driving distances - to sight-seeing areas. We checked into a regular King-size room. Compared to similar king-size rooms in other hotels, this was a huge room. The room included a desk, desk chair, two sitting chairs and a table next to one chair. We also had a microwave oven and a small refrigerator. Nice conveniences. The bed was very comfortable.Breakfast included some made-to-order omelets along with a few other warm items. They also had a big bowl full of fresh fruit, coffee from an expresso/latte machine.The price for the room was a very good value for the room and the breakfast. I wouln'd mind staying there again.\n",

With that being said, I am sorry to say the breakfast staff in the lobby were some of the rudest I've ever met, on BOTH days we stayed. One was a man, the other a woman. I even asked the woman if she was okay, as she had a terrible scoff on her face when I had the audacity to reach for something (after excusing myself), which her reply in an incredibly disrespectful tone was, \"I WILL be\".

We mentioned it politley and quietly to the front desk staff. We were told that the managers would be alerted. We never heard from anyone about what they were going to do about it, switch rooms or what have you. We even then threatened to check out, and with no effort to make it right simply allowed us to check out. Poor service.\n",

The very friendly staff assisted with coordinating many of the hotel's amenities--especially the complementary limo service to destinations within a 3 mile radius of the hotel. Additionally, the complementary breakfast exceeded our expectations and included made to order waffles and omelets, among other options. And I have not even mentioned the room, which was wonderfully clean. I loved the clean wood floors, rather than tired musty carpet. Finally, the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever experienced. This hotel was truly a delight. I hope other Wyndham properties will compare!\n",

The only thing that stopped me from giving five stars is that the shower in room 105 was brutally forceful. I like a shower with good water pressure, but I felt like I was being beaten, and I could not reduce the pressure. Also, the driveway is all torn up (perhaps because of recent snow) and needs to be repaired. \n",

Monique and Chris were helpful in every way with such a great attitude!! Chris even caught on to my name (by the Beatles) and whistled the tune as I was making my tea! :) Craig and Dwight drove me everywhere I needed to go... in a limo!! They were also extremely nice and helpful!! Made the experience that much better. Last but not least, F. M. Moore was one of the cooks there that made an awesome loaded egg white omelet. I was fortunate enough to be able to spend some time talking with him before I left. The room had hardwood floors, oriental rug, recliner, comfortable mattress, clean and smelled good.Overall, this has been one of the best places I've ever stayed. Not because it was the most upscale either, which don't get me wrong, it was nice... But because of the wonderful people!! Not stuffy at all and I would recommend anyone staying in that area to stay there!!\n",

      "  Review : Atlanta was a last minute change of plans after weather turned awful in New York City area. I wanted a nice stay for the three of us and stumbled across Wingate Atlanta/Buckhead by accident. Their 20% discount for a three-night stay was very attractive and even better than the usual AAA rate. Check in was quick, efficient, and the desk staff were unfailingly courteous and helpful with things such as directions to local attractions. The cookies for guests at the desk were a nice, homey touch. The lobby and breakfast area are modern, cozy, and spotless. Our room was a nice size, well-furnished, and clean. The TV selections were good and having a microwave and fridge are a definite plus. The bathroom was immaculate and well-stocked with good quality soap, conditioner, and a hairdryer. The fitness center has a good amount of equipment and was also spotless. Although it was too cold to try it out, the pool area and spa look as if they would be inviting on a nice, hot Atlanta day. The fresh cooked breakfast omelets and waffles were much better than at our other recent hotel stays. This hotel was definitely a cut above others we have stayed in previously and I'd be willing to pay a bit extra on future trips to stay with Wingate. \n",

The rooms were spacious but made a little crowded by all the furniture. The beds and the bedding were very good quality. I'm pretty sure that the tv actually had an HD picture. I got a great rate and everything except my two drinks at the bar was included. There was a very good complimentary breakfast with an omelette and waffle station. There was bacon, sausage, biscuits, gravy, grits, etc. I used the business center to print my aquarium tickets and wasn't charged. There is no bell service so you'll have to take care of your own bags(no big deal for me) but there is complimentary limo service, yes I said LIMO, within a 3 mile radius. There are a ton of good to great restaurants in the immediate area. I really loved this place.\n",

      "  Review : My family stayed at the Wingate in Buckhead this past weekend. We visited Atlanta to go to the aquarium and when I was searching for a nearby hotel, this one came up with great reviews. I booked our rooms on their site and got very good rates. The hotel exceeded my expectations. The staff was extremely helpful and nice. They treated us as friends. Our room was clean and the beds were super comfortable. Breakfast was included and it was fantastic both days. Everything was fresh and warm. The hotel is about 15 minutes away from the aquarium and downtown Atlanta so it was close enough to drive to our destinations but also far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the city. We got in and out of the hotel with ease and there are many places nearby to shop and dine. I can't say enough about how great our stay was and we will be staying here the next time we are in Atlanta.\n",

We were offered very reasonable rates, and I was a bit worried about what we would get for such low rates. I was thrilled and amazed at what I found when I arrived:Beds: The beds were clean and comfortable. For the entire three days I stayed there, my colleagues and I joked that we would be late due to sleeping in because the beds were so comfortable.Service: We were greeted daily with warm and sincere smiles from the staff. They were simply wonderful.Food: The owner/manager was the in-house chef and provided a delicious breakfast and lunch each day. Additionally, he baked fresh cookies each day, which awaited guests in the lobby. Transportation: We were transported to and from the mall, dinner, airport, etc. in a stretch limo. We had a grand time!The Wingate did an amazing job of making us feel at home away from home. I will surely look up this hotel when I return with my family for pleasure.\n",

But the air conditioner/heater can't be turned off, there was light from the street and traffic. Also, this was our honeymoon night. The first thing an employee asked me at breakfast the next morning was 'if I had anything under my robe because the guests were staring.' Well, maybe because it had BRIDE written on the back of my robe in sparkling stones. I was wearing a dress underneath which I showed her but it was really embarrasing. Congratulations would have been more appropriate than an interrogation. Other than that, it was a pleasant stay. Tip - wear footies because the hardwood floors can get a little cool.\n",

There are many differentials such as the free limo transportation to nearby areas, the daily hot breakfast with amazing biscuits and made to order omelets, the very nice coffee machine providing delicious coffee drinks anytime (the latte is amazing), the cookies in the afternoon, newspaper every morning and a courteous front desk. Rooms are comfortable and well decorated and the hotel offers free self-parking. I didn't use the swimming pool or the restaurant. Location is great and definitely the stay was an excellent deal.

Even the paint job, which had two different colors and a white trim showed that they went the extra mile to give you a luxury feel, even though the rate was for a budget accommodation. We had two doubles, with crisp, tastefully done bedding, a 42 inch samsung flat screen tv, and many lighting options. The shower was great, as were the toiletries. At breakfast, there was a lovely gentleman making custom ordered omelets, as well as home made waffles. There is an outdoor pool and hot tub that we did not get to use, as the weather was a bit inclement. We really enjoyed our stay here, and I will definitely stay here again when I return to visit my daughter in Atlanta.\n",

      "  Review : All around this hotel meets your expectation from customer service to its very reasonable pricing.Its location to dining venues & major shopping malls in Buckhead is a plus but this hotel exceeds expectations with the limosine ride to these areas that is included in the rate.The buffet breakfast with a made to order omelette station, variety of foodstuffs and the fresh cookies on arrival are all a hit.This is a well maintained property with warm decor from lobby to the beautifully appointed rooms that offer granite in its rooms and bathrooms, microwaves and refrigerators for your convenience.We selected this hotel because the Intercontinental Hotel where we normally stay was booked due to Columbus Day and Pride Parade festivities however I would recommend it for families, girls weekends and small conferences. The pool area offers a relaxing change of pace from the busy that is associated with Buckhead. Lastly the Atlanta Fish Market is a must place to dine when you stay here..its so close and so very good seafood.My first time at a Wyndham but not my last.\n",

      "  Review : I don't really understand how this hotel charges such reasonable room rates and provides such excellent service. My friends and I booked a room Thursday-Sunday for Music Midtown for $107 a night. We had two very comfortable double beds, a very large HDTV, and a really nice shower. Everything was spotless. The included breakfast comes with an omelette chef, biscuits and gravy, and other treats. Best free hotel breakfast I've ever had. Furthermore, there's a stretch SUV limo that will take you anywhere within a 3 mile radius for free! It was funny getting dropped off by a limo at the MARTA station, but whatever. Still a good time.The one snag came when I checked out, they overcharged me $30 per night. I got a good deal through the Wyndham website, maybe that had something to do with it. Anyways, they fixed it right away when I showed them my confirmation email. Extremely friendly and helpful staff.\n",

The rooms were nice to look at (and to stay in), the internet was free and fast, the breakfast was free and ample, and the location in Buckhead is good too.

Of our five hotel stays, this place also had the nicest bathroom facilities. Loved the shower! Also, I've never been in a hotel before where the rooms had hardwood floors! I thought it was a neat touch.Every staff member we came in contact with was very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the wide array of breakfast options - I took advantage of the omelette bar : ) We found our room to be very quiet. The hotel seems to be in a very quiet area, while still being very close to Atlanta, which meant sound sleep and a quick trip to the city the next morning! Very nice place - really enjoyed our stay!\n",

The complimentary breakfast is incredible and offers a variety of choices to include made to order waffles and divine omelettes. Chef RM prepares and folds the omelette perfectly every time.

      "  Review : This was not my best stay away from home.I thought I was planning a romantic weekend getaway for me and my husband. We went to a concert at Chastain and decided to stay at this hotel. We arrived about two hours before the concert. I was told that transportation would leave in an hour. When we went in our room it had a horrible smell. It smelled closed up like the room had previously had water damage. When I went to the desk the person offered some spray for the room. Because we were late I did not have time to change rooms.The spray did help with the smell. We went to the concert and enjoyed ourselves. The driver asked that we call when the concert was over. The driver said he would be there shortly. He arrived in about 10-15 min. When we attempted to get in the vehicle he asked that we go to another area because he could not load there. So we walked down and waited for him to come. well other patrons opened the door and they loaded where he said we could not get in. When he pulled down to us the car was full. The driver apologized we sat outside for about a hour and a half and they finally sent a totally different driver because the first car was stuck behind an accident. The room has hard wood floors and I was on the third floor I listened to someone walking day and night especially at night. Housekeeping half cleaned the room especially the bathroom which looked like ther is mold growing in the shower. I will say besides the person who check me in on my first night that for the most part the staff was friendly especially that staff in the dining area.\n",

My one of two complaints is that room service didn't come to clean until 3:00PM and I had already made it back in my room by then so I told them never mind. I was still ok with everything even with my room not being cleaned and I hate to write this but the last day (complaint number 2) I turned on the light and I saw a small little critter (roach) running around scared out of his mind. Fortunately I was leaving so I didn't freak out BUT where there is a small little critter there may be a big little critter somewhere else.\n",

Comfy bed. The bad - hairs all over bathroom to the extent I wondered if last occupant opened a Great Clips. Gross! The shade (see photo) is not cloth and allows in the maximum amount of morning light. Not good! The walls are paper thin. I am not a fan of using the chest of drawers provided (see picture) but the inhabitants next door prized them and jealously examined their contents throughout the night.

      "  Review : My friend and I stayed here for a nice girls' weekend over Labor Day. We flew into Atlanta to drive to Auburn for a college football game, but then needed somewhere to stay when we returned to Atlanta on Sunday.I stumbled across the Wingate on Groupon and amazingly it was available for the holiday weekend. It's a nice hotel in the Buckhead area. We were fairly close to lots of shopping and some of our favorite restaurants.The rooms were nice and quiet. I don't think we heard anyone above us or in the hallways at night, which is a bonus for any hotel (I travel a lot, so this is a huge feat). We have a small fridge so was good to keep some bottled water to come back to after being out in the heat and humidity during the day. The beds were super comfy plenty of TV channels to flip through after a long day out and we were just wanting to chill.Breakfast was included in our stay and there was a chef on hand to make eggs to order or fresh waffles. Along with the normal fruit, yogurt, and muffins, there was biscuits and gravy, bacon, and sausage. (The gravy could have been a bit warmer, but was still good)\n",

      "  Review : We're normally faithful to a different brand, but once again, we chose this hotel based purely on Tripadvisor's rating - well, that, and its proximity to our Labor Day plans. Having now experienced this hotel for ourselves, I'm absolutely baffled at the handful of \"terrible\" reviews it received! I'll admit, when we drove up (in the pouring rain) my husband's first comment was, \"THIS is the #2 hotel in Atlanta??\" I was a little surprised myself by the nondescript exterior, but once inside we were encouraged. (A sloppy, rainy day can make anything look less appealing :-) The lobby was lovely, the desk clerk genuinely warm and friendly, and our check-in was flawless. We received a room exactly as we'd requested - 2nd floor or higher and far from elevators and ice machines. Our two-doubles room was every bit as nice as described in the reviews we'd read - tastefully decorated with gorgeous duvets, European pillows with matching shams and throw pillows and gleaming hardwood floors. That was a nice bonus since our little boy has asthma. Both our room and bathroom were plenty spacious - not expansive but adequate - and both were sparkling clean. The bathroom had marble walls and floors, granite counter tops and gorgeous decorator fixtures. The shower was awesome, with a \"waterfall\" shower head that rinsed the shampoo from my thick hair in seconds and hot water was instantaneous. The bath amenities were also a step up from the 3-star norm - Citresse spa products all with a wonderful citrus scent. The in-room coffee maker came with Wolfgang Puck gourmet roast (regular, bold & decaf), Half n' Half creamer and even a small sampling of Lipton hot tea bags. The complimentary breakfast served between 6 & 10 included fruit, yogurt, cereal, waffles, breads and pastries along with several hot items and a made-to-order omelet station. Perhaps my favorite feature was the 24-hour coffee station which included made to order (via self-operated machine) cappuccinos, lattes and espressos. Every staff member we encountered was courteous, friendly and helpful. And all this with FREE parking to boot! What more could anyone possibly expect or ask for at this price level? We'll be back!\n",

      "  Review : We'd been planning a trip to Atlanta for some time to visit the Georgia Aquarium, Coke Museum and tour CNN. When this hotel became available on Groupon, we jumped all over it as it sounded like it was just what we were looking for logistically and from the standpoint of amenities. Turns out we were right. Everything about the property lived up to expectations from the buffet breakfast to the cleanliness of the room (hardwood floors were especially nice) to the friendliness of the staff (Monique at the front desk was wonderful), and it was a very convenient 10-15 minute drive to downtown Atlanta.\n",

Continental breakfast was deluxe with fresh, made-to-order omelets and Belgium waffles. Free parking...complimentary limo service to anywhere within 3 miles of the hotel....all fantastic bonuses. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Quiet rooms were nicely decorated with clean-smelling air (no stale, musty or cigarette smell). I would recommend this hotel without reservation. Thank you for hosting!\n",

I was in Atlanta for the Bruno Mars concert and wanted to stay close to the Marta system. While it was too far to walk to the station, the hotel gave me a ride to the Buckhead station and instructions for the return trip. The room was so clean, the bed was great, and the breakfast was outstanding. The 3 items I look for in hotels are safety, cleanliness, and friendly employeees which I received in this hotel. Will stay here again for sure. \n",

We attended Josh Groban's concert at Chastain Park. When we pulled up and say the Limo jokingly said wouldn't that be great to get a ride to the concert..... When we checked in Chris asked if we were going to the concert... Limo leaves at 7:00. Nice ride to and from and great concert. Also provide limo service throughout the day for any trips around the area. If you are planning to attend concert @ Chastain would not stay anywhere else. Very clean and well appointed rooms. Great breakfast. Al around great experience. Will be back soon!!!\n",

The only down side was the bed wasn't that comfortable to us. We thought we booked a room with a huge jet tub, but the tub we got was a little small. It did have a jet setting though. Other than those small nuances, we really enjoyed our stay. They have a complimentary limo within a couple miles of the hotel, which in Buckhead, can be a lot of places! We were able to take it to dinner at Portofino and they picked us back up. Made sitting in traffic very hassle-free! Breakfast was very good! There was a chef that prepared fresh omelets. Options were very good as well. Wonderful place to stay.\n",

The level of training of staff is superb, professional yet friendly. Handsome public space, nice pool with towel service. I stayed in a beautiful spacious suite, with wood floors, large flat screen tv's, bathroom with a separate shower and a two person spa tub.I was blown away by the breakfast that included a station with chef prepared omelets and waffles, muffins and more baked on property, three different styles of eggs, grits and meats, as well as fruit and Espresso/cappuccino maker available throughout the day. Evening meal service with great food options, from soups to main dishes, a great addition to their beautiful bar. Free wifi and stretch limo service were the cherry on top. Great value, would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Buckhead and beyond!\n",

It has cappuccinos, espresso, and lattes made fresh. We also planned to use the Marta for touring downtown. The free limo took us to the Marta station and came back in the afternoon to pick us up. They also took us to dinner at places within 3 miles of the hotel.The drivers were great and gave us lots of valuable info on getting around using the Marta. Our room was large with two queen beds. There was lots of space to move around. Wi Fi is free. I loved the tv remote. It had a smooth surface, not buttons to push. I read that remotes in hotel rooms are some of the filthiest things you can come in contact with while traveling, so the clean smooth remote was great. The flat screen tv is large and all channels are in hi def. The room has a large desk and lots of lighting. Floors are wood and ours was mopped daily. The window covering is a pull down type, not bulky curtains. I loved how the hotel is aware of people like me with allergies. There is also a cordless phone in the room. All local calls are free. Loved this hotel. I will definitely be back\n",

      "  Review : What a nice hotel in a nice area of Atlanta. Buckhead is apparently high-end - we did note that the nearby Lennox Mall was upscale. This hotel is tucked away in a quiet business area and feels quite safe --- we took walks in the morning and in the evening with no sense of concern whatsoever. This particular Wingate has extras like a limo service to surrounding areas, a bar, and better than average breakfast - with scrambled eggs, omelet and waffle service, fresh fruit salad, all of which were missing at our next hotel - when we left Atlanta and stayed at a Wingate in Destin, we really noticed a difference - so I'd say this particular hotel's good ratings can be attributed to management of this property. Staff was so friendly (hats off to Ms. T who treated us like family), and everything was clean. Pool and hot tub were very comfortable size. Nice-sized rooms and comfortable beds. I would definitely stay here again if in Atlanta. This hotel deserves between a very good and an excellent rating.\n",

The staff was somewhat friendly but not over the top friendly as I had read in reviews prior to my trip. The only negative I experienced was the tight parking lot spaces. It was so difficult at times to get in and out of the vehicle and parking away from others was not an option due to the hotel being sold out. There were cars parked in the front of the hotel during the weekend due to the lack of available spaces. It was nice to have free parking, but the lot needs to be redesigned.\n",

We requested it and the limo driver arrived a VERY large party, hopped in the limo, before we could. The driver informed us, that someone would be available to assist us momentarily. He was right! Another man appeared and whisked us away in a range rover to our dinner destination. A VERY nice substitute! Both drivers (I REALLY wish I remembered their names) so nice and helpful. One (the range driver) informed us of citypass.com, which allowed us to get passes for all the attractions we wanted to see without paying a separate amount for each. The hotel was very nice, the ONLY thing I would change is the cookies on the cookie stand. I'd wrap them individually, to protect people from germs. The breakfast was great! the waffle man (I cant remember his name.....hmmm maybe there is a trend here) was a gem! Other than that the stay was great! I WILL stay there again. \n",

      "  Review : A five star experience from the moment I stepped in - the professional yet friendly and helpful service, handsome public space and I had the fortune to be upgraded to a gorgeous suite, with wood floors, large flat screen tv's, a bathroom that had a separate massive massage shower, two person spa tub, massive counter and full accoutrements. Surprise omelet station in the morning, super fresh baked goods and fresh fruit, Expresso/cappuccino maker, and top facilities. Matched with free wifi, stretch limo service and business office this has to be the best value in town! \n",

      "  Review : I have never been to Atlanta and was going with my family (one child 11 yrs old) and husband over July 4th. I asked on TA for recommendations. The one that panned out was the Wingate at Buckhead. It was great for what we wanted and I have to say the service was super...wow I have stayed at much higher rated hotels than this and they didn't compare to the service. Front desk so nice, the shuttle/limo drivers all of them were super kind to my very excited son. The breakfast staff was so friendly and helpful to a very busy hungry breakfast crowd each morning. I can't say enough about they staff...room was clean and roomy. We will return when we are in the area:)\n",

They even have an espresso machine you can make lattes and double shots with! My only issue was that our room wasn't usually cleaned until 4:30ish each day. This messed up our dinner/afternoon plans a lot since we had to shuffle them around to accommodate this situation. Otherwise a great stay. \n",

The pool is inviting and quiet for an afternoon of relaxing in the sun. The rooms are well appointed, beds/pillows are extremely comfortable and everything is clean. The hotel is an easy walk to Hal's Steaks & Johnny's Hideaway. It's a fun area! If you prefer to ride, there is a limo ready to drive you around until 11 PM. There's also a chef preparing a delicious breakfast in the mornings. \n",

      "  Review : I had been away from this hotel for a while. It had been some time since I was in the Atlanta area.This used to be the go-to hotel for me, but I think it's time I start searching for a new one.I've seen restaurants, hotels and other businesses fall down a but because they lose one person. I think that may be the case here. It used to be when I went through Atlanta and stopped, I was greeted by Mr. Hines-Tecoy. I'm now told he no longer is there, and that is a shame.If I had a question, it used to be answered immediately. It was 'How was this, Mr. Earl?' 'Do you need any help with that, Mr. Earl?' Those days seem to be in the past. No eye contact when I came in, an avoidance of saying anything, offering help and generally just trying to stay busy so not to answer my questions.The rooms still are fine, but that personal contact is gone. Seems a shame, but I'm going elsewhere the next time I'm in Atlanta.\n",

You'll feel like a moviestar!The location of the hotel in buckhead is perfect but you have to know that it's not downtown. To reach Coca Cola, CNN or the aquarium you have to drive for about 30 minutes or take the train.However it's worth to do so because the hotel is great and buckhead is a very nice community with a lot of restaurants and bars.\n",

Every evening at the hotel we found it very difficult to find a space to park our vehicle. There were several church vans that took up more than one space and even a moving struck that parked sideways taking up more than three spaces. I feel the hotel should have some sort of policy for larger vehicles (e.g. large vans, moving trucks, etc.). In addition, any guest that is visiting patrons at the hotel should have designated guest parking so they are not taking up a space for those who are actually paying to stay at the hotel. \n",

We were grateful for the microwave and refrigerator in the room where we could store items and re-heat. The breakfast buffet was also very nice, with fresh made waffles, omelets, grits, and bacon. There are lots of restaurants within walking distance or a further walk, if you prefer. The pool was especially nice for my son to keep up with his swimming routine, while away from home and missing swimming practices. The staff was always professional, courteous, and helpful providing recommendations of places to see/do, coin laundry facility, and numerous pickups/drop-offs at the MARTA station in the complimentary Limo. Thank you all: Monique, Marquis, Chris, Marie, Nate, Craig, and Dwight for making our time away from home a pleasant one. We plan to make another trip back, to see all of you AND ride the new Ferris-wheel! LOL\n",

      "  Review : This was one of the best hotels I've stayed at yet especially with in being in Buckhead. It was a great location and I was near everything. but what I was most impressed about was the customer service. The guy at the check-in went out his way to make sure everything was good with my room. The interior of the hotel was impressive too. The room was very nice, hardwood floors, nice bathroom, they had a chef fixing omelettes in the morning and everything. They also have a free limosine service that takes you within a 3 mile radius to wherever you want to go which was even more impressive. Overall, I enjoyed my stay and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Great upscale restaurants nearby and shopping and you're about 10-15 minutes away from Downtown depending on traffic. \n",

      "  Review : Loved the Wingate Buckhead! 4 nights for a wedding. Great pricing. Centrally located, clean, nice and comfortable. Great air conditioning and nice pool. Plenty of parking. Bathroom a tad small but updated with nice tub and shower. Really Comfy beds--yippee! Really liked the carpetless floors, though I think it's hard to keep up. Wish bar was open earlier and later. Lobby breakfast and bar are great. Wonderful place to visit with wedding party and guests before and after events. Helpful staff and delicious cookies at front desk. Nice touch: comp limo within three miles of hotel if available. We tipped driver. Very nice!\n",

Our large standard room had a king bed, desk and chair, chair with footrest and an extra chair. Nice room, no complaints. This hotel is located several blocks off of a freeway in a buisness area. We found fraffic getting to the hotel, at times, to be bumper to bumper. Limo service is provided over a several mile area. Full Breakfast is served. Lots of good restaurants in the area.

      "  Review : Stayed here while attending a conference for the weekend. The location is outstanding and the hotel itself is convenient to shopping and all things \"Buckhead\" The rooms are modern, and tastefully appointed. The bedding and towels are high quality and comfortable, The hot breakfast is one of the best I\"ve ever enjoyed. Especially tasty was the bacon. Where else can you get an omlette cooked to order? If you wish to shop, the hotel's complementary limo service will take you anywhere you wish to go (within a short distance) but the area where this hotel shines is the staff. They are pleasant, knowledgeable, and very helpful. I think the ONLY drawback here are the window views....not much to look at.. I highly recommend staying here. \n",

      "  Review : from the sanitized remote (thank you) to the hardwood floors (vs carpet), this property is first rate in cleanliness in addition to have comfortable linens, a decent complimentary breakfast (have the omelets rather than the scrambled eggs), and friendly, welcoming staff. It's quieter than central buckhead but very close still. And of course in the evening if you are dining at a Buckhead restaurant, ask about the free stretch limo that will take you and pick you up within three miles of the hotel. We have stayed at this hotel before and recommend it for consistency, convenience comfort. Caution: the beds are a bit taller than a short adult can manage gracefully.\n",

      "  Review : Excellent value; clean facility, pleasant employees; would definitely return. Only one glaring problem was that the employee who fixed omelets (at breakfast) had gloves on but used his gloved hands to dig into the cheese and sprinkled the cheese on the omelet as I waited. He also bused the tables with the same gloved hands and I noted that he went back to the omelet station (after busing tables) and repeated this process for others waiting for an omelet with cheese. I dumped the omelet he made for me. He may have used the same damp cloth to wipe off the omelet machine that he used to wipe off the tables - not sure about this.\n",

They could not do enough for us. Friendly is the understatement. Only hotel to stay in when in Atlanta. We went for a Braves game and used the limo to the MARTA, Limo was very cool and driver was excellent. The driver said they were expecting rain so the front desk staff gave us an umbrella to take to the game....nice touch. The rooms were clean, hardwood floors with an area rug. The staff gave us places to eat and places to see. They seem to be a very cohesive group. Rooms are spacious. Breakfast was scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, and a fresh making omelet station They have beverages in the lobby at all times. What a wonderful experience! Would definitely stay again! (We moved on to Savannah after this stay and stayed at a very upscale hotel and this hotel beats them hands down.)\n",

The grand daughter really was counting on swimming: the manager made sure the pool was filled and open for her. We used the hotel limo to go out to dinner, and to go to and from a Marta stop for our aquarium visit. Both chauffeurs could not have been nicer, and the car was very luxe (grand daughter really liked that ride!) Best of all, we were so close to so many good restaurants, and I could even walk to a drugstore. The breakfast, including the omelet station, was a hit (I especially liked that they offered sugarless cold cereal -- and those hot cookies were yummy!) The rooms and furnishings were exactly what we expected. I can not recommend the hotel and all the staff enough -- they made for a perfect vacation!\n",

And great convenient location!We were in town for our company convention and it was just far enough out to avoid the crowds but only a 10 minute drive to the Georgia Dome & Convention Center. The breakfast is amazing. Custom made omelets and waffles, grits, fresh fruit & a very nice expresso & cappuccino bar. We powered up every morning and it was so nice not to have to eat that expensive convention center food. I like their committtment to hiring mature staff. Manning the omelet station was a marvelous retired exec who was 81 years young and his partner was 73. The front desk staff were warm and super helpful.Our home office is here and I never need to stay anywhere else!\n",

The location is very convenient, the rooms are very clean, spacious and comfortable. I loved the wood flooring (possibly a laminate but nicely done) in the rooms and wish all hotels would take this step toward getting rid of carpet. Every staff member we met was more than helpful. The free breakfast is one of the best I have had. My son had a similar experience with staff during his June stay and utilized the shuttle (limo) service almost exclusively for traveling around town. He was very impressed with the quality and service provided during his vacation. I see no reason to stay elsewhere while visiting this area of Atlanta.

It would have been much better to let me know a more realistic arrival time as I could have remained in the building and worked instead of standing on the street.

It was the first time that I had seen a hotel room with laminate hardwood floors rather than the ubiquitous carpet. It was a nice touch and contributed to the overall sense of cleanliness. The staff were very accommodating. My father arranged with the shuttle driver (it's a stretch limosine) to open the door for her and call her by name (the royal treatment!) He obliged and offered some great advice on local restaurants. If going to Atlanta (for the aquarium), stay in Buckhead and take the MARTA to city center. The hotel will drop you off at the station and pick you up when you get back.\n",

      "  Review : Being lifelong Atlanta Braves fans, my 23 year old son and I decided to go to Atlanta for a couple of Braves games on a Friday and Saturday night. I did my duty as a Tripadvisor believer to find a good hotel for 3 nights. As I searched Atlanta, I was looking for reasonable price, mid to upper scale hotel, free or inexpensive extras such as internet and parking, and good location to Marta.The research showed that there are four areas to consider: downtown, midtown, Buckhead and perimeter. I did not want to stay in downtown because of safety concerns at night. The perimeter area would be fine but I did not want to stay that far out. So, I searched the other two areas. Most of the midtown hotels charged $20-$30 per day for parking and many charged around $12 for internet usage. Since I would be using Marta to get around, being a little further out in Buckhead was fine.Some of the hotels in Buckhead had similar charges for the extras but many had free onsite parking and free wireless. I chose Wingate by Wyndham because it met all my criteria. I usually look for Marriott properties first but they had some of the extra charges.Buckhead is a middle to upper class area. A lot of shopping and growing business area. Thus, traffic was a bit heavy but not unmanageable when we drove around the area. It is very safe.When we checked in at the Wingate, the staff was friendly and welcoming. They helped with questions about places to eat and how to navigate the Marta.The room was very nice and clean. The floors were laminate hardwood-looking, not carpet. Not sure I like that but it look very upscale. The beds were very comfortable. The only issue I had with the rooms was more about the housecleaning. They missed cleaning up a towel one day but not that big of a deal.The location was on a fairly busy street. There was only one way into the property. Thus, getting into the parking lot was a bit tough sometimes due to traffic but not something I have big issue with. The nearest Marta station was 1 1/2 miles away. The hotel had a shuttle service that will take you anywhere within a 3 mile radius. So, they will take you to the station and pick you up when ready. It does stop by 11:30 p.m. The Braves game may last a long time and there is a chance that we would return past 11:30. So, here is a tip. The Lindberg station is 2 miles away and it has Marta parking. (Buckhead station does not) We drove to the Lindberg station and parked for free. Rode the Marta to the game, returned and drove back to the hotel. Worked out great.Breakfast at the hotel was good. Not a huge selection but adequate.Overall, this is not a 5-star hotel but it is very nice for what I wanted. Exceeded my expectations.I would stay here again when I return to Atlanta. I certainly would choose the Buckhead area.\n",

      "  Review : My husband and I traveled to Atlanta for our anniversary and stayed at this hotel from 5/30-6/2. When booking the reservation, I made sure to note that we were staying for our anniversary. When we arrived, we received a warm greeting and were informed that we were upgraded to a suite for our anniversary. This was a pleasant surprise and we knew right away that we were going to enjoy our stay. This hotel has many perks (free hot breakfast, free internet, free parking, free use of the business center) that made our stay very comfortable. The room was always clean and the breakfast buffet was pretty good. The hotel was also pretty quiet which was nice considering our room was on the first floor and not far from the lobby. The only disappointment that we had was the morning we checked out. We had an early flight that morning and had planned to get breakfast before heading to the airport. The breakfast buffet was supposed to open at 0600. We arrived at 0600 on the dot and saw that they were still setting up. Some other hotel guests were waiting to eat as well. We sat and figured it would only be a few minutes. Then one of the attendants informed us that someone in the kitchen staff had called in sick and that the breakfast area was closed until 0630. Because we had to get to the airport, we could not wait another half hour and we left. We ended up having to purchase breakfast at the airport. We understand that they couldn't help that someone called out, but it was an inconvenience since we had planned on having a free breakfast. Other than that small hiccup, we really enjoyed our stay. And even with the breakfast situation, we would still stay at this hotel if we're in Atlanta in the future.\n",

They offer a complimentary free limo service within a three mile radius. Great to and from the Buckhead Marta,to and from the Lennox square mall etc.Hot breakfast complimentary as was photocopying and email printing. Free wifi .Marta train from airport to Buckhead then complimentary stretch limo to hotel means it is easy to get to hotel. Downside. Swimming pool out of use due to work being carried out. Not much of interest nearby, but with free limo this is not a problem. Would return.\n",

      "  Review : My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights, originally booked in room 208. On the second night at 1115pm we were woken up by the sound of someone talking loudly. We initially thought it was someone in the hallway, but later discovered it was the person the adjoining room. She was taking so loudly on her phone that we could hear everything through the connecting door! We called the front desk who then called the guest and asked her to lower her voice. To no avail. At 1145pm we called the front desk again and were told that we could move rooms as \"there was nothing more they could do\". Then things got absurd... The night manager then tried to put us in room 219 - across the open balcony from the front desk!! We refused as we were trying to move away from noise not towards it! The elevators were out of service apparently so rather than walk up the 2 fights of stairs to provide us with new room keys to another room on a different room, the manager stood on the main lobby floor and THREW room keys up on the balcony for us to catch, as he suggested one bad room after another. This was like a bad \"Fawlty Towers\" episode. We eventually agreed to switch to a room on the 4th floor - but one that did not have a King bed which is what we had booked and what we had moved out of. It was past midnight and the night manager did not even offer to help us move rooms -- even with the elevator being out of service!!In the morning we talked to the (new) front desk manager who was suitably horrified at our disastrous night of room moves. She moved us (again) into a suite across the hall on the 4th floor which was wonderful. Unfortunately it was too little too late. We would NEVER stay at a Wyndham hotel again.\n",

      "  Review : We stayed for 3 nights. Had never stayed here before and didn't make the reservation until we were enroute to Atlanta from SC. Called them to check on rates, because of hotel's location we thought it might be a good choice, and I'm so glad I did. We stayed in one of the larger suites on the 5th floor. We had no street noise or noise from the hall. The bed was very comfy. We chose no room service during the stay but returned each evening to find fresh towels waiting by our door (without having to request them). The hotel staff was super, very eager to help in any way, and very friendly (there was a \"welcome back\" every time we came back in the hotel). They had a full HOT breakfast every morning. If I had any negatives about the stay here it would be that the air unit was a little noisy during the night but nothing that kept us awake.\n",

No noise from the elevator as it's tucked into a side room along with the ice machine. Room had microwave and mini-fridge. Desk staff were very friendly and helpful and arranged a late checkout for us. Breakfast was delightful, with made-to-order omelets and waffles; a seemingly limitless supply of bacon, sausages, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, cereals, fruit, juices, etc. The breakfast area was spacious, with glass doors looking out to the pool. Free parking too. We got a nice AARP discount on the room rate. We highly recommend this hotel.\n",

      "  Review : So I booked four hotels in Atlanta, 2 downtown and two in Buckhead. Two priced on the higher side and two on the lower. Wingate was on the lower side and due to the #1 review of the hotel (at the time) on TripAdvisor, I just had to pick it. Now I am the kinda girl who like 4 and 5 star hotels (the Lowes) that are amazing on the inside and outside with AWESOME amenities. I had seen the pictures on Wingate and did not understand how it could be the #1 hotel for the price of 90 a night and the average looking décor. When I arrived at Wingate it looked just like the pictures, very small and average. The rooms were small, not modern...Just plain. The bathrooms were small and everything was just kind of blah with no color scheme. I was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong everything was super clean and comfy, but not WOW! After my initial disappointment me and my Fiancé got ready to stock the room with goodies and walked downstairs where the Limo Driver Craig (who we just came to love) took us to the nearest grocery store, left, and picked us up again with just a phone call. We used this service throughout the entire trip (5 days), it made us feel special!! I have to talk about the entire staff, something that never mattered to me before with other hotel stays. The staff made the small 3 star hotel a LARGE 5 STAR HOTEL! Every person went out of their way to help you and have a relationship with you. We were never in the rooms so the size and décor, ended up not mattering. They had a great FREE HOT breakfast each morning, and free parking. The limo will pick you up and take you three miles away...you can drink in the limo, play your own CD's...basically party! The hotel bakes cookies and keep them at the door so you can get a free tasty treat throughout the day. So if you are the kind of person who cares HIGHLY about appearance this hotel is not for you. But if you want a hot breakfast, free parking, to be taken care of by the staff, to feel like your home on vacation....THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU! We will definitely be back. We even left little notes for the limo driver letting him know he made the trip AWESOME! There are sooooo many Bars and Clubs within walking distance. A mall within two miles, a theater, grocery stores, literally everything right there. And the limo can drop you off in style. Please give this place a try, you will end up loving it.\n",

Let me tell you, the management team has done their research and knows what it means to be a leader in the hospitality industry. Here is a short summary of what made an impact on me: Hardwood floors in the HUGE guest rooms with marble and granite bathroom counter tops, exceptionally long and comfortable work space, very dark rooms at night due to the black out shades, germ free TV remote control provided by Clean Remote ™, open alcohol bar with free snacks, sizable breakfast with many options, including made to order omelets, outdoor pool, shuttle service via limo, easy check in, walking distance to shops/restaurants, beautiful lobby area, short drive (3 min) to the St. Regis, free and fast wifi, free parking, safe, spotless, extraordinary customer service from front desk staff to evening bartender to breakfast hostess. Although, it was competitively priced for the area, it was just a tad high for me. However, the prices are more reasonable on weekends. Would have given five stars if the rate was lower.\n",

The check in to the hotel was fast and easy. the king suite is a nicely appointed room - spacious with a large bathroom and a kitchenette which was nice to have for the 2 nights we stayed. the TV is located in the \"den\" area and not real close the bed, so you had to turn up the volume and i was afraid that i may be disturbing the neighbors....i would probably relocate the TV. The location in buckhead was close enough to visit the location attractions. the breakfast was pretty good - hot and cold items. They have a chef that will make you either an omlette or waffles. also have the usual cereal, bagels, yogurt and fresh fruit. I would stay here again if i ever visit this area again.\n",

They have a complimentary shuttle (stretch limo) for everything within 3 miles (restaurants, MARTA station, etc.) until 11 pm, complimentary breakfast with cook serving waffles and omelets, all of the staff were so friendly and making sure our stay was complete.

I won't stay at this WIngate again even though the location is good. Not worth my good money.  \n",

Checked in late on Friday and staff was very attentive even though it was quite late. Found the rooms to be clean and spacious and staff to be friendly. Staff members greeted us each time that they saw us. Breakfast buffet featured freshly made omelets and waffles and good assortment of pastries, fruit, cereal and other breakfast fare. We didn't use the limo service, but it was a nice feature to use for any location in 3 mile radius of property. Will definitely stay here again, if in the area.\n",

      "  Review : We had a good stay, and we especially liked E.M. the omelette chef. Rooms were nice, staff very friendly. A minor quibble is that right at 10 they take away breakfast, and don't even leave the coffee out...it would be nice if they left free coffee (and water) out all day.However, we had one major issue. We asked the front desk to reserve us a taxi for 4:45 am the following morning to catch an early flight. The next morning the front desk told us our ride was outside and when we went out there was no taxi, but the hotel's own shuttle bus/limo. Since there is a sign in the lobby mentioning the complementary shuttle service (subject to availability) we assumed that this was a nice added perk. When we arrived at the airport we asked the driver if we owed him anything, and he said we should have already been charged and should have been given a receipt.When we got home I checked my receipt and found that indeed we HAD been charged $60 for this trip. I called the hotel and left a message for the general manager to call me back. The GM did not call me, but he had a staff member. When I explained what had happened, she told me that normally the taxi cost is $50 plus $10 per additional person which would have totally $70 for us, so the hotel charge was actually saving us money. I told her that should have been explained to us up front.After speaking to her, I checked a few Atlanta taxi websites, and they mostly showed a flat rate from Buckhead to the airport of $40 (or less) plus $2 per additional passenger, so roughly a $50 fare....which was LESS than the $60 that hotel charged us.I'm not so concerned about the $10, BUT I feel like the hotel should have advised us up front, and given us the OPTION of using their limo vs. a taxi. No one every told us that they were NOT reserving a taxi, nor did they explain we would be charged or WHAT we would be charged. This left a sour taste in our view of the hotel. Also, when leaving a message for the GM it would have been nice if the GM actually was the one to call back.\n",

Being that our team won the national championship, my review may be skewed to the positive, but I think I would have made the same statements regardless. Nice place, good breakfast, very courteous staff. I'm not sure what rates are normally like, but they didn't completely jack theirs up for the Final Four as many places did. Limo shuttle service (anywhere within 3 miles I think it was) can get you most anywhere in Buckhead that you want to go, or it can get you to MARTA station if you want to go downtown.\n",

      "  Review : My daughter and I visited Wingate by Wyndham with a friend and her daughter during the dates, March 11-14, 2013. We absolutely loved everything about this hotel—the staff, the rooms and the location! Our room and bathroom (larger than regular size hotel rooms) were clean and wonderfully furnished. The hardwood floors were beautiful! Throughout our visit, housecleaning remained thorough and timely!I was particularly impressed with the staff. My daughter (age 14) enjoyed going down to speak with Monique (who was extremely efficient at the front desk) and eating from the tray of daily displayed cookies. The limosine driver was wonderful! He was helpful, receptive and so pleasant! Free limo service within a 4 mile radius was a plus in an unfamilar city. We used the service daily! Daily breakfast service was both, adequate and extensive. The cook to order chef was an older gentleman who was always pleasant and appeared to enjoy serving. Though we were in the city during spring break for touring and college visits, I must say, our stay in the Wyndham was the PLUS that made our visit to Atlanta memorable!\n",

The limo ride to the Marta was nice- we never returned early enough (after 11pm) to utilize the return ride but it wasn't that bad of a walk back to the hotel from the Marta station. We could have easily grabbed a cab, but the weather was so nice we just chose to walk. The 24 hour beverage station was a treat, we ended up saving a lot of $ forgoing Starbucks with the machine making pretty decent espresso shots. Breakfast had a smallish buffet but everything was really good! I have to speak up in defense of the omelette guy that we had- I can't see how it could possibly be the one people are commenting on. He was such a nice, southern gentleman! This hotel has earned it's rating! Rooms were clean, beds comfy, and quiet.\n",

The breakfast was hot and offered many items. There were cookies in the afternoon (which the kids loved), appetizer foods in the evening for everyone to enjoy. One of the best parts, was the FREE limousine service to anywhere that was in 3 miles of the hotel. This included the MARTA (public transportation system...subway and buses). All you had to do was request your time to be taken and then just call when you were ready to be picked up. The front desk was knowledge about the area, suggested restaurants and even called ahead to make a reservation for us. The kids also loved the hot tub. The business center worked well if you needed to look up attraction times, print tickets, etc. This was a great hotel for families visiting Atlanta, the neighbor hood was very nice also. \n",

I had issues connecting to the wi-fi every single night, so I had to pay my telephone service provider to set up a temporary hotspot so that I could complete required coursework online.I am not familiar enough with the Atlanta area to find my way to restaurants in the evenings and would have loved to have had a dining option inside the hotel. Instead, I had to bring groceries with me (I guess it's lucky that I was driving in).\n",

The stretch limo shuttle service is really a special touch. Both drivers were friendly, as was the front desk staff. We were treated very well. The breakfast buffet had a latte,espresso, coffee machine. Nice touch also. Breakfast was fine, just not outstanding. Relative to other hotel experiences, and for the price we paid, definitely a five star experience.\n",

The location is convenient, and an added bonus is having a limo to shuttle you to dinner or surrounding shopping. The breakfast is great, and much better than other hotels that offer a free continental breakfast. I appreciate all the little extras like a welcome goody bag, warm cookies in the afternoon, and the free tasty hors d'oeuvres in the evening. The hotel is tastefully decorated, but I appreciate that they are currently going through renovations to spruce the place up\n",

      "  Review : We were extremely pleased with our stay here. Unfortunately, our flight was delayed into ATL so we did not check in until late that night (a 5 hour flight turned into 9). It was clear we were tired and hungry when we got to the front desk. Unfortunately, I do not remember the gentleman who helped us, but he picked up on this right away and had us checked in immediately and gave us a list of places to eat, but on top of that, he highlighted the places that would be open and his recommendations. Once my ears perked up at one type of cuisine, he immediately called the restaurant to see if they can accommodate us. He told us to drop our bags off in our room, let him know if the room is ok (which yes, it was), and he would have directions for us by the time we get back down. We couldn't have been more pleased with him going the extra mile and taking care of us in such a great manner. As others stated about the room, it is hardwood floors with an area rug. I found the room to be spacious enough, and the bed was very comfortable. I slept great. I like the anti-microbial tv remote too. There were plenty of electrical outlets to plug all our devices too. The shower was nice and there is plenty of counter space in the bathroom. If you want a quiet room, I suggest you request for one as we had no noise problems during our stay.The complimentary breakfast was pretty good too. You had a made-to-order omelette guy, who is also a waffle guy. There was definitely something for everyone at this breakfast and I left satisfied. And I left with some fruit for me to snack on later too. Overall, convenient location in Buckhead, great rooms, great night sleep, and excellent service.\n",

      "  Review : I stayed at the Wingate for a couple of nights in Dec 2012. I flew in from the Middle East on business and was dog tired when I finally got to the desk. (Fourteen hours is too long for any sane person to stay in a cramped airline seat.) Good front desk attention and they worked with me to check in early. Yes, this is an older property, without a lot of extras, but they really do seem to try hard. Breakfast had a good selection with eggs cooked to order. The omelette I had was done perfectly. Bed was comfy, shower felt like heaven, internet was fast enough. The surprise was when I asked for the complimentary ride to the mall, and I was taken in a stretch limo. I felt a little silly, but it was a nice treat. When I was done shopping, a quick phone call and my limo pulled right up to where I was waiting. The driver was a friendly guy and we chatted about it. He mentioned it was one of the few things they adopted to stand out from all the hotels in the area. They knew they weren't the shiniest and didn't have the most amenities. I thought it was a clever idea. I can easily forget a basic, comfortable hotel, but probably won't forget my surprise at being chauffeured in a limo! A larger property might offer room service, gyms, spas, bars, and restaurants -- which are all great things when you are on a high-end vacation and want to be pampered. This little \"hotel that could\" offered friendly service, a clean and comfortable room, and a little hutzpah. I applaud their efforts. Nice.\n",

There was also complementary 24 hour a day in the lobby lemon or lime ice cold water, a cappuccino machine, hot tea, coco, coffee and cookies. An added attraction was the super size limo that took all of our parents and cheerleaders back and forth to the Marta for transport into downtown Atlanta each day at no charge.

What more do you need to know?My only complaint was a mechanical noise that was audible all night. I DO have sensitive hearing but my husband heard it too. Did not keep me from sleeping, at all, but it was the one thing that was not perfect. The walls are a bit thin, could hear our neighbors when they came home. It's possible that this was just in a certain room (320) , so we are definitely coming back and will ask for a room at a different section of the building.\n",

      "  Review : I found the Wingate in Buckhead while searching for a venue for my company's annual sales meeting. It's in an ideal location - close to MARTA, shops and dining options. I didn't realize this hidden gem could accomodate a meeting for 60 attendees with plenty of meeting space, a boardroom, and a large dining area. The owners were super nice and met with me in advance to plan the menu, transportation and room accomodations for my group. They were very proactive with suggestions to ensure the meeting ran flawlessly. Our group utilized the hotel limo to and from all 4 of our dinner events each night. The owners personally made sure the 4 1/2 day meeting ran smoothly and they checked in with me often. The staff was very friendly and went above and beyond to ensure our attendees needs were taken care of. The chef personally made sure my guests with dietary needs were taken care of in advance, and the kitchen had no problem offering glueten free and vegetarian meals. The food was excellent - very fresh and much better quality than I've experienced at other hotels. My room was nice and clean with hardwood floors, a large flat screen TV, and a comfortable bed. As an event planner, I know from experience the price is very reasonable for a Buckhead property, espcially for a 4-day meeting for 60 people. The Wingate does not nickle and dime you for photocopies, use of the business center or gym, and they offer comlimentary Internet throughout the hotel! I was very pleased with this hotel, as was my Executive Team. I'm confident we will host future meetings at the Wingate.\n",

      "  Review : Lovely staff, lovely room (although the sink could have used a spritz of bleach, and the floor should be more carefully mopped - there's always something anywhere you go - even the Ritz, I'm sure!). The bed was SO comfortable - like sleeping on a cloud!You will want to make sure and bring a sleeping mask, if light bothers you when you sleep. Hubby didn't mind, but, to me, there seemed like too much light was coming in from the windows, even though both screen and blind were closed. Sleeping mask made it a non-issue.The room is very nicely appointed. One problem was the tiny amount of space between the bed and the desk chair. We should have moved it, and will in the future. If you get up in the night, you may forget it's there and trip.Great climate control, nice big TV. Pretty quiet. They got us a room on a high floor, away from the elevator, just as we requested. No surprises, just a bill under the door in the morning. All in all, a nice stay!\n",

The only downside was that we were told the hot tub was opeational, and it took almost 2 hours for it to be cleaned and heated. :( :( :( I thought you guys offered a manager's reception in the evening, but was told it was only during the week. :( \n",

      "  Review : I stay in hotels hundreds of days a year, easily one of my new favorites. Centrally located and super easy to get to. As soon as you walk in the front lobby your greeted warmly and welcomed and assisted in anyway you need. Fresh cookies in the lobby and super easy check in. The lobby is quaint and contemperary, there is a full service bar and the bartender is super friendly. We stayed on new years eve so expected all of atlanta to be a party. We werent disappointed with the atlanta party and was overwhelmed at the assistance afforded us by the staff of the hotel. The rooms are clean and feel warm and cozy. There is pargoe flooring and a large rug makes the room feel homey. Microwave, refer, large tv, clean showers and bathroom, extra blankets in the closet and VERY quite. The hotel also has a great ammenity. Anywhere within 3 miles there is free motel shuttle. Of course the shuttles are as plush as the hotel itself. Stretch hummer limos dawned in black and subtle motel name on the door. Again I must mention its free. Buckhead is clean, safe and beautiful. The only issue with our stay was waking up on nys day with the hotel and block around it out of power. A squirrel blew the transformer out front st the hotel lost power. No panic. Woke, emergency lights were on in the hall and with the elevators out had to take the stairs to the lobby. Candles lit everywhere and staff scrambling to make breakfast as pleasant as possible and done with FANTASTIC fashion. Power was quickly restored in the rain by georgia powerand light and the hotel went full tilt and boogy. Theres a staff chef there for breakfast in the morning welcoming you and making fresh omlets with you choices of ingriedents. All an ammenity. Since the power went out there was NO rush to get people checked out which was a super friendly thing being new years day. The owner/manager walks his property checcking on things regurlarly making sure things are safe and to his standard. Overall PERFECT STAY AND I HIGHLY SUGEST A STAY!!\n",

The rooms have hardwood floors which seems much more sanitary than that nasty carpet you usually get in hotel rooms. The bed was super comfortable with what felt like a pillow-top mattress. The free breakfast was the best I've had at a hotel for free. They have a chef that will even make your own omelet for you! Also, parking is free, which in Atlanta, is a great perk!\n",

      "  Review : I had points to use and booked a free night here. I was able to do early check in and the staff was extremely courteous. The room was beautiful, with laminate hardwood floors and was very spacious. I have to say the main plus was free parking, which is very hard to find in the buckhead area. There is so much to do around the hotel, its great. There's also free Internet, which is also hard to find at nicer hotels. Breakfast was also great as they make waffles and omelets to order plus they have actual breakfast food like grits and bacon, and not just cereal and fruit. My only complaint, if you could call it that, is the channel selection as it seems like half the channels available are news and not very kid friendly (I love my cartoons). Other than that this hotel is excellent and will definitely stay here again.\n",

      "  Review : I had lived in Atlanta and chose this primarily for its very convenient location...at least for my purposes. Close to many restaurants and nearby St. Joseph's Hospital complex, yet quite quiet for a restful evening. Breakfast was complete with a cooked to order omelet station. There was a free high quality commercial espresso machine complete with milk frother located in the lobby area and available for use at all hours. Having lived in Italy for many years, I feel I know good coffee. Free parking was a bonus. Staff was also fine. I would certainly stay here again.\n",

It's pretty well known that the remote is the most contaminated device in a hotel room.

      "  Review : First let me start with the good things! The front desk staff was friendly, helpful, and efficient. The lobby and all of the commons areas were bright, attractive, and clean. Location was good...not quite in the heart of Buckhead, but good. It was quiet...no annoyances from either outside traffic nor 'hall sound'. The bed was very good and the bath had ample size vanity. The room was clean when we checked in...the cleanup the next day was another story!!! Without going into details..I would have fired the housekeeper! I had to go to the front desk to ask for (a few of the things the housekeeper left out), replacement coffee, ice bags, glasses (she simply took the used ones and left no replacement) . The gentleman at the front desk got them for me immediately (instead of having me wait on housekeeping to bring them up). There were 2 small issues with the room that I am sure they would have fixed had I asked (didn't want maintenance there for just a 2 day stay)...the ground fault plug in the bath didn't work so I had to dry and curl my hair in the bedroom...the lav in the bath drained very slowly and would fill up while you were running water (nasty). The wood laminate flooring was buckled up in quite a few places. The room layout was slightly inefficient...there was a big open 'seating area' but only 1 chair...all the rest open space (unusable......good place for a second chair or small sofa). There was no nightstand nor bedside table on one side ...since the bed was the only choice from which to watch t.v. (there was only one chair) there was nowhere to set a drink nor anything else except the floor. I might go back but would check other places first.\n",

      "  Review : My best friend and I were in the area for a dance competition this past weekend 10/19/12 to 10/21/12. Since I work for a Wyndham in a different state that is in need of some help, I found myself having high expectations for this place in knowing what to look for and the high rating it has on this and other sites. I was not disapponted! The front desk personnel was hilarious and personable. He let me know of everything that was available in the hotel including the limo shuttle service (that was one of the best parts). My best freind laughed at me the first twenty minutes as I inspected the room and everything little thing. Nothing wrong or out of place but the tiniest rust spot was on the bottom corner of the tub. The room was perfect and exceeded what I had in mind even after I went in excess with my inspection. The housekeeping staff takes pride in their work and you can tell. The beds were like clouds. After a long day of driving and hours at the competition it was wonderful to return to a bed like I have at home. Breakfast was great, the omelet chef was good (they do their omelet station differently here than at my hotel) and very quick with his service. The mini waffles were a genius idea because not everyone eats giant plate sized waffles. I know the next time I come back this will be the place we will be at!\n",

      "  Review : What a pleasure to stay at this fine hotel!! Arrived at the airport and called to find out the best way to get to the hotel from ATL. They directed me to the Marta ($2.50 plus $1.00 for a Breeze pass refillable) and told me to call as soon as I arrived at Buckhead station as they would send the shuttle to pick me up. The \"shuttle\" turned out to be a stretch limousine that was also available for free transportation within 3 miles of the hotel. This was definitely the most economical and rapid way to get to the hotel from the airport and with elevators at both ends, it was not difficult even with luggage. The room was large with a generous bathroom, excellent exercise facilities and an American buffet breakfast with made to order omelets and Belgian waffles available! And included in the price. \n",

      "  Review : My husband and I usually prefer to stay in high end hotels when traveling, but decided to try out the Wingate, because it was in a great location, and seemed adequate for our short visit. From the time we arrived, we were WOWed by the superb, friendly service and the exceptionally well appointed, comfortable and immaculate rooms. Everything from the large screen TV, bright lighting, extremely comfortable beds, clean hardwood floors, granite countertops, refrigerator, in room safe, gorgeous bedspreads, non-allergic pillows, morning newspaper delivered to our room....we couldn't have hoped for a more pleasing experience!!!\n",

      "  Review : Since I'm being forced to complete this field, the only tip I could think of would to be to have a town car available to take guests around the city instead of a stretch limo, stretch limos are nice but not everyone likes to be taken to a Starbucks or mall in a stretch limo, it could make them feel out of place or possbily a target for theft.\n",

      "  Review : We have stayed here several times before. It has always be a very pleasant stay.The rooms are large, and always spotlessly clean. Reception is friendly with cookies to make you feel welcome.There is a nice outside swimming pool but it felt a bit cool for a swim in October. The only problem with the pool area is that it allows smoking. The hotel is proud to be smoke free for which I am very happy, but sitting outside by the pool we had to 'share' second hand cigarette smoke. It would be nice if the whole hotel area was smoke free.Breakfast is a buffet with the option of freshly cooked waffles or omlettes. The chef works hard to make everyone feel very welcome.There is free WiFi and cable internet, but on this occassion it did not seem very reliable, and devices took a bit of coaxing to connect.Buckhead is a nice area and this is a good hotel.\n",

      "  Review : Wingate is a mid-sized, mid-priced hotel located in the tony part of north Atlanta called Buckhead which has been described as the Beverley Hills of the East. The neighbourhood is quiet, and is a mix of small hotels, upscale multi-family dwellings, and higher-priced residences. The hotel property is very neat, landscaped, and well laid-out. Parking is free and ample. Check-in was trouble-free, and the staff was friendly, professional, and accommodating. Our room was modern, smelled clean, looked clean. We had a fridge, microwave, safe. The indoor pool was small, and was only large enough for cooling off. The fitness center was limited to one each of treadmill, elliptical, bike, dumbbell rack. I would suggest that the hotel provide coin-op laundry within its premises. It is a convenient place to stay for a few nights if you want to see the attractions in downtown Atlanta such as the Coke museum and CNN headquarters. Just a couple of blocks away from the hotel is a dining district with many excellent restaurants and bars. I would consider Wingate as a top choice for a reasonably-priced hotel in Atlanta.\n",

Not only did they have a complimentary light buffet available well into the evening, they offered complementary limo service to take you to and from any restaurant you chose to dine at during the evening. The delicious complimentary full breakfast buffet was complete with made to order omlettes. And the staff, well, they all treat you like family with that genuine hospitality that lets you know that they are really there to please you. Marie was simply wonderful. As I checked out the next morning after being met at the counter with a bright smile, I was totally blown away when I was asked if I needed a ride anywhere. This was my first time as a guest at a Wingate. If the service I received was typical for any location, I may never stay anywhere else.\n",

I found the Wingate by Wyndham based on reviews here on Tripadvisor, and this place fit the bill perfectly! Buckhead is a hip, fun neighborhood with lots to do. I got an Internet rate that was quite reasonable, and the hotel itself was flawless. The staff was attentive and friendly, the free breakfast was wonderful -- with quite a few hot choices, and it was kind of fun when the free stretch limo shuttle dropped me at a local restaurant. The experience could not have been better.\n",

Every staff member was personable, knowledgeable and went above and beyond to make our stay perfect. In fact, my daughter wasn't feeling well and the hotel manager made soup for her - that is typical of a five star hotel. I highly recommend this hotel and would stay there every time I visit the Atlanta area.I am an event plannr, so I have traveled a lot and do not take the time to rate hotels unless I was overly impressed.\n",

It is a more business-oriented hotel (ie, no fancy decor and no spa), but stays plenty busy with weddings, etc on the weekends (when the rates seem to drop). Always clean and ALWAYS friendly front desk. Love the hardwood floors in the rooms and granite, roomy bathroom counters. I have come to appreciate the buffet breakfast served daily, too.

Not walkable to the nearest MARTA stop, but they provided wonderful shuttle service within 3 miles of the hotel which was very helpful. However, we would never recommend this hotel or consider a return stay because of how damp the rooms were. It literally felt wet and smelled musty. We had business papers in the room and they were limp with dampness. The linens felt damp. We complained and were provided with dehumidifiers which we realized later didn't help at all because the water level in the humidifier was full. The hotel staff seemed to be aware of the problem but unable to do anything about it. I have never stayed in an environment where the linens actually felt damp and papers in the room were limp with dampness. It was very uncomfortable. I realize the humidity in Georgia is high this time of year, but we stayed the night before at a Hilton in the area and there was no problem with humidity or dampness in the room. It is specific to the HVAC system and problems with this particular hotel. Unfortunately, the friendly staff and cleanliness of the hotel could not make up for how miserable the stay was due to everything seeming so wet in the rooms due to unbelievably high humidity. Would not recommend and would not stay there again due to this HVAC problem. \n",

The rooms are spotless, the pool, breakfast were great and the staff were so friendly, they could not do enough for us. We loved it that much we stayed for 1 extra night on the way home and the staff all remebered us from our previous stay. the ride in the limo was a real bonus and the location in Buckhead was great. Would definatley return to the Wingate as everything was so brilliant, the staff are a real credit to the hotel and should feel very proud of their customer service and enthusiasm. Thank you so much.\n",

      "  Review : I stayed at Wingate mostly due to a concert that I was attending at Chastain Amphitheater, and I also got a great deal on Travelocity. The Buckhead location is very nice and within walking distance of lots of shops and restaurants. ALL of the staff were extremely friendly, helpful and welcoming. The room was a nice size, had wood floors and came with a mini-fridge and microwave. There's free parking and hot breakfast, which saved me at least thirty dollars a day. The complimentary stretch limo to/from the concert was a nice touch. I took one star away because there was a large mold stain on the ceiling. I assume there was a leak from the floor above. Also, I didn't care for the bathroom products. They smelled like men's cologne. I believe the brand was Quercus. \n",

      "  Review : I recently travelled to Atlanta with a fractured ankle and crutches. If I am being honest, I originally booked my hotel elsewhere which offered valet and room service to make my stay as easy as possible given my situation. Unfortunately the hotel double-booked my room, and after a very hectic day of travel I was sent to Wingate as an alternative. I was extremely disappointed and showed up at Wingate very grouchy. I was immediately greeted by Chris at the front desk who assured me that he would do anything to make my stay as comfortable as possible - and he did just that! They changed my room to a suite on the ground floor, provided me with take out menus, carried my bags for me, watched my belongings as I picked up my car, and even had Craig - the resident limo driver, drive me to and from a local restaurant for dinner. I would like to say that this was special treatment for my fractured ankle, but everybody that I met that was staying there had an equally positive and accommodating experience. Every time I crutched up and down the hall I was greeted by name, and was asked by EVERY staff member how they could help me. I thought this was going to be a terribly uncomfortable trip, but it was just the opposite! \n",

I was not able to sleep throughout the entire night for my two day stay. Since this is an issue with the design of the cooling unit, there was nothing for me to discuss with staff. I have stayed in other hotels that have quiet air conditioning units that essentially are central heat and air systems. The other issue was the first room I was given had not been made up. This was quickly resolved by the front desk.\n",

As if the hotel wasn't nice enough they also offer free limo service within a 3 mile radius to which my wife and I took advantage of and this was special to my wife as she has never rode in a limo before and she enjoyed the experience.

      "  Review : My name is Alfredia Lizzmore, and I am really BIG on customer service. Excellent customer service is a determining factor in most cases, even if the situation may not work out in my favor whether I will return. As a customer service representative, you must always keep in mind, that you are a customer when you are on the other side of the counter. Therefore, it is very important that you are confident, yet careful in what you say, and how you say it to others! With that being said, I would like to express my gratitude towards Alan and Monique!!!!!!!!!!! They both provide EXCELLENTWONDERFUL customer service on a personal and professional level. Although my arrival was not what I expected, but at no fault of the Wingate, nonetheless Alan and Monique understood my concerns and frustrations. They were very professional, friendly, apologetic, also offering their assistance to accommodate me with any questions or needs during my stay.As a result of how Monique and Alan made what could have been a very unpleasant situation, but ultimately resulted in a much needed Amazing weekend. Therefore, whenever I am in ATL and require a hotel stay, I will be making my reservations At the Wingate by Wyndam-Atlanta.So again I would like to give BIG THANKS to Monique and ALAN for making my stay a enjoyable one!!! May God continue to shine his light through both of YOU and continue to Bless You both and your families.**The Limo service and drivers was a Wonderful Perk, the breastfast was very good, the other staff were very pleasant and helpful. The room were spacious, the bathroom was clean. The only thing I was not fond of was that I went out after breakfast, my room was not completely cleaned to my satisfaction, but I managed and slept well :-)Smiles and Blessings,Alfredia\n",

      "  Review : The hotel is located in a nice area of Buckhead a few miles from Lenox Mall, Peachtree, street, etc. We were in town for a Braves game and some shopping. It took almost an hour to get to the stadium because it was rush hour and the police blocked off a couple blocks about 2 miles from the stadium for a \"suspicious package\". Ordinarily, it would take about 30 minutes. All of the staff we encountered were very nice, smiled and were very responsive to any needs. The lobby is nice, but nothing special. You can tell that the rooms were updated in the not too distant past. However, they were very average. The room had plenty of space and the furniture was pretty good. You could tell the hotel was older. The floor was a laminate type wood that had several areas that had points that didn't stick to the subfloor. That was really the only issue with the room. The shower is really nice....very spacious and new. The company and staff seems to have done what they can to make your stay a good one, but there are just several better options withing a 5 mile radius. If you can get the room for a good price, it's worth a stay. We paid $229 a night. It's not worth that.\n",

From our request to be in a room away from the elevators to our rides in the stretch limo (woo-hoo!) to the restaurant suggestions everyone was always friendly and ready with answers. Add to that fresh omelets and waffles in the morning and cookies in the afternoon - what could be bad?!? Okay, so the Chinese Restaurant was a little longer than \"just across the street and walking distance\" but the walk justified all the vacation eating indulgences. The Buckhead location provided easy access to both the main highways for our day trips and the metro station for our travel into downtown. All in all this is a wonderful place to stay for your visit to Atlanta and it is easy to see why it so highly rated.\n",

      "  Review : We arrived at the hotel after a long flight from the UK for an overnight stay. We had booked it based on the Tripadvisor rating of number 1 in Atlanta, expecting it to be great value and a good experience. Unfortunately it fails to deliver on both counts.The first problem was that they didn't have a bellboy available at 10pm. This is not what I would expect from any hotel, let alone one rated highly. Anyway, so I had to move my own luggage up to the room.The room itself was clean and large enough, but completely non-descript. It could have been any Marriott, Hyatt or other chain from anywhere in the world. The view from the room over a dull carpark was no better. The cord for the blinds broke within 2 pulls and I didn't bother to report it - I assumed that since they had no one to carry bags, I'd have no chance of getting a blind fixed at night.Next, why have they put in beds that are so high?? They were so high that our 4 yr old couldn't get into without help and they are so high that it was dangerous for children who have a tendency to roll around and occassionally fall off.The breakfast the next morning was fine, but again didn't understand why the great reviews on Tripadvisor. It was acceptable for what it was - a limited choice buffet, but nothing more.The best thing about the hotel was the reception staff on the morning of checkout. She was very friendly, courteous and helpful and extremely attentive. She said she had just relocated from Florida and was very nice to talk to her.Given that the hotel was $25 per night more than the Downtown Courtyard Marriott, I don't feel it offered good value. I would not recommend this hotel as number 1 in Atlanta.\n",

      "  Review : I stayed at this Wingate for a short business trip in Atlanta. I typically stay at Hilton-brand hotels since I am an Honors Gold member but my company booked this hotel for me. Upon my arrival, I was greeted by the front desk clerk. I was checked in quickly. The lobby was very clean and quiet. I parked in the back of the building by the pool. The parking lot was a bit cramped because there were several big trucks, but do-able. My room was on the 4th floor. I had a 2 queen bed room. My room was superb. The bathroom was freshly cleaned, I could smell the bleach. There were several towels and washcloths. The complimentary soaps, lotions, shampoo, etc were pleasant. I wish I had gotten some extra soap for the road. The bed was super comfy. I slept like a baby. The pillows seemed a bit small at first, but once I tucked in for the night, all was well. I didn't hear any road noise. The sheets and comforter was perfect.I was a little disappointed with the list of TV channels, no MTV, no Vh1 so I couldn't get my junk reality TV fix. But there were 3 different HBO channels. The remote was \"clean\" I guess it gets sanitized with each guest.There was adequate storage space for my things and plenty of hangers for my short trip.The WiFi was free and fast. Plenty of plugs to charge my cell, laptop and iPad big plus. The lighting was nice. The light switch was located at the entry and right in between the beds, no need to get up and risk tripping over all my junk.The location of the hotel is close to many offices and an office park across the street. Lenox mall is a quick drive. The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle that will take you anywhere within a 3 mile radius... in a strectch limo. Nice touch! We were able to arrange a ride to the airport using the limo as well.The breakfast was great. The dining area was comfortable and the food temperatures were appropriate. Cooked to order omelettes and waffles are available. There was also bacon, sausage links, eggs, yogurt, various cereals, fresh fruit, coffee and a cappucino/expresso maker.I didn't get a chance to have a drink at the bar, but it is fully stocked from what I could see.It was a bit difficult to exit the hotel during traffic but during rush hour, the police direct traffic so it could be worse.If in town on business again, I will definitely stay at this hotel.\n",

      "  Review : We have stayed at Wingate-Buckhead several times in the past 3 years. The service is always excellent. The breakfast buffet is delicious! Everyone that works at this hotel is extremely friendly and helpful. We plan to return in a couple of months. My son is a patient at Shepherd Center. The hotel is in a great location for us. Keep up the fantastic work!\n",

      "  Review : Thanks to Trip Advisor we chose this hotel, and so we now want to return the favor and to encourage other guests to do the same. We also were welcomed by a very friendly reception staff and felt like we were leaving nice new friends the next morning. We admired the lobby with its beautiful marble mosaic floor (as we later discovered: Atlanta likes to show off its granite). The breakfast was superb with delicious fresh fruit (a rare occurrence for us in US chains), cappuccinos and lattes freshly ground, fantastic grits (I grew up eating grits so I can taste the difference), omelets and waffles freshly made to order. Our room was very tastefully furnished and had a comfortable bed, which was a little too close to the air conditioning for us, but other rooms we peeked in didn’t have that problem. And the free internet was very fast. The extra special little touch was, of course, the stretch limousine. We couldn’t believe our eyes when the nice driver picked us up at the Marta station. With complimentary service within a three-mile radius and quick pick-ups and returns, we were able to go out to eat “in style” and thoroughly enjoyed the somewhat incredulous looks when we exited “our” limousine.All in all, we are very happy to have stayed here at a three star hotel with five star friendliness. And we really cherished the difference between Wingate and the generic high-rise hotels that Atlanta has so very many of.\n",

      "  Review : This wyngate was obviously another brand before, but Wyndham did a good job of renovating to their high standards. It is a little hard to get into the parking lot, but name a hotel in Buckhead that is easy! The staff is very pleasant, check-in was a breeze. The evening food (free) and bar service (not free) was good and the breakfast was well staffed and had a good variety. We took advantage of the free Limo service to a local restaurant, not too shabby showing up in a stretch Expedition. We were only there one night before moving on to the mountains, but we did enjoy the stay very much. Great value for the location.\n",

Besides the helpful, friendly staff, clean rooms, wonderful breakfast, complete with latte and omlettes, you have a ride to the show in a stretch limo with a very accomodating and professional driver. He knows the back routes, drops you off right at the entrance and promptly picks you up afterward. You party, he drives:) It doesn't get better than this...ROCK ON, WYNDHAM!\n",

      "  Review : I recently stayed at this property for a quick getaway. I reviewed the property in advance but did not make a decision until arriving at Hartsfield Airport. Called the property from the airport and Monique was great in booking reservation and arranging for hotel's limo to pick me up at Buckhead MARTA station. The property is centrally location to great food and shopping. My trip was strickly to relax and pamper myself. Staff, Monique & Marie recommended great places to eat, drink, shop, get pampering services which were nearby and limo was available upon request. The property offered afternoon cookies and lite fare as I enjoyed the spa pool. The hotel full bar was an added bonus as I relaxed and watched the opening Olympic ceremony in a safe environment. Finally, the full breakfast was great each morning with enough variety over several days. This property is a hidden jewel in the middle of Buckhead without the traffic or fuss. This was money well spent and I will run away from home more often the my new found tresure.\n",

      "  Review : My wife and I made a trip to Atlanta this past weekend to celebrate her retirement and to attend a concert at Chastain Park Amphitheater. After reading a number of reviews of the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta - Buckhead, we chose this hotel for our stay. Check in was smooth and accomplished by some of the friendliest hotel front desk staff that I have ever met. We were quickly shown to our room which was very spacious and very clean! We also inquired at the front desk about the possibility of having the Hotel Limo drop us off and pick us up at Chastain Park before and after the concert. The front desk staff quickly arranged for this and had the driver check with us to make sure of our departure time needs. At the appropriate time, we met the driver in the downstairs lobby and were safely whisked away to the concert at Chastain Park. We were dropped off directly in front of the gate we wanted to enter the Amphitheater and were given a business card with the driver's direct cell phone number to call when we were ready to be picked up. At the end of the concert, we called and by the time we had made our exit, we were once again greeted by the driver and driven back to the hotel. The bed was extremely comfortable and afforded a great night's sleep. This morning we enjoyed a wonderful individually prepared omelet breakfast with bacon and sausage and an espresso coffee. For genuine courtesy and hospitality thru the entire stay at the hotel, I cannot recommend this hotel high enough. For value received, I would gratefully give it 10 Stars if I could. There is no doubt that when we return for another concert at Chastain Park, the only place we will consider staying is the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta - Buckhead.\n",

After complaining that the air condition filter was very dirty we were offered a dehumidifier which we had to keep on all through our stay. We had to empty its bucket numerous times.The noise was too loud it disturbed our sleep but whenever we turned it of, the humidity went up to 90%.

      "  Review : Pros: The included breakfast is by far better than the usual continental breakfasts you get at most hotels (Delicious omlettes and waffles made to order plus a variety of tasty cafe beverages e.g. cappucino, latte, espresso, etc. from heavy duty auto machine.). Free Wi-Fi and free parking are also included. Overall, this hotel is a great value, and we plan to make it our go-to hotel for all future trips to Atlanta! On another note: we appreciated that the floor in our room was not carpet - don't believe it is real wood...probably some type of laminate, but much more hygienic than carpet.Only 1 Con: Our room (#423), which was pool-side, did not have blackout curtains...Not a huge issue for us, but the pull-down shades covering the windows did not completely block out sunlight early morning...If you want to sleep in and require complete darkness to do so, ask for a room that doesn't face the sunrise or for a room with blackout curtains (if available).\n",

The breakfast was wonderful and included made to order waffles and omelets as well as fresh fruit, cottage cheese, yogurt, muffins, eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy,etc. The rooms were extremely clean - especially loved the hardwood floors in the rooms - and the beds were very comfortable.

      "  Review : We recently stayed here for our 20th Anniversary and to attend a concert at Chastain Park. The staff was very friendly and the complimentary limo service was great! We were disappointed in our room for a couple of reasons. My wife decided to take a shower and while standing in the shower adjusting the temperature the knob for the shower came off and bounced off of her toe! Since these are kind of heavy, she is still sporting a sore toe. When I carried the knob down to the front desk the clerk was not very concerned about my wife or our need to get this fixed quickly. Secondly, the motel advertised black out curtains. Since our room was on the front, at 6:30 am our room was bright enough to get a tan. I tried several different ways to get the curtain closer to the wall and finally gave up. We could not close our bathroom door since it was swelled due to moisture but the maintence man told us he would have to fix it after we left. Our maid would come by and get our towels in the morning but would not drop off any for our use until she came back to clean the room. Otherwise the motel was nice and the breakfast was very good. I have stayed in lower priced motels that had the same of better ammenities.\n",

      "  Review : I must say I was most unhappy when I checked out of the Wingate Inn in Atl. in July . When making reservations for Jan. and March of 2013 for my next business trips and was told they would no longer honor the rates that I have had for years with you when in Atlanta on business. I have a retail shop and have been staying with you at this location for years at the $109. per night rate . I am usually there around 16 days a year attending the Atlanta Gift shows at the Atlanta Merchandise Market downtown. I am aware I am a small Georgia business and can't compete with the big corporations and their multiple nights per year committment to you, however I was given no explanation for the huge increase in my rates and they definately didn't seem bothered to loose my business. Small business are vital to this country and it would be most helpful if we received only some of the considerations that the large corporations do. I have enjoyed my years staying with you, the employess, on the floor , are delightful and most helpful , I'm sorry not be able to say the same for the management.

We were cheerfully greeted upon our arrival by both the front desk personnel AND a plate of fresh cookies. My husband was really happy to find the espresso machine in the lobby as well. Our room (a king suite) was spacious and clean, and our family of 5 had plenty of room to move and sleep. We enjoyed the limo shuttle to dinner one night, took advantage of the swimming pool, and also enjoyed the late afternoon snacks that included fruit, cheese, crackers, veggies, egg rolls and chicken wings. The free breakfast was really great, too, and the staff was friendly when preparing made-to-order waffles and omelets. The room rate was perhaps slightly higher than a couple of other hotels I'd checked, but when you factor in the free parking, free breakfast, and availability of a spacious suite, this was clearly the better deal. We will definitely stay here again.\n",

Small but functional pool that was fine for a hotel in an urban setting. The free breakfast was great with a big selection of hot and cold food. Room was comfortable with a safe, fridge and microwave and good air conditioning. Hotel offered a free limo service which I didn't use but looked good value. Only downside to this hotel for me is it's location, if you turn left out of the entrance within seconds you are in the midst of the Buck head traffic, which is great if you are there on business, but as a foreign tourist this made daily driving very stressful. \n",

I have never stayed in a Wingate Hotel before, but this one in Buckhead was lovely. The trip downtown wasn't too bad. (It's not far at all, just the regular Atlanta traffic.) The front desk person was delightful and perky! The hotel itself was well appointed and had everything I needed. I thought that it was refreshing that the floor in the room was hardwood (or man made looking hardwood). Also, I loved the professional Italian cappuccino machine on the breakfast bar. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. I have no complaints!\n",

Chris and the other staff members (front desk, housekeeper, limousine drivers, breakfast attendants, and bar attendant) were very professional, polite, helpful, and made us feel like we were at home. We appreciated the limousine service to and from the concert, and to one of the restaurants located in the neighborhood. All of you deserve five stars! We'll be back in the very near future!\n",

      "  Review : The rooms in this Wingate by Wyndham Hotel in Buckhead, Atlanta are HARDWOOD - such a nice touch, have never seen it anywhere. Also, the staff at Reception went out of their way to be welcoming, pleasant, accommodating, and customer-oriented. The hotel itself is clean, well-located but otherwise your typical business hotel. These two aforementioned features make it stand out. Oh yes, the omelet station at breakfast is also a nice touch!\n",

      "  Review : we stayed at wingate because of trip advisor's rating. although nice and comfy with decent service, this was far below our expectations. this hotel is like a souped up days inn or something. it was clean and the rooms were spacious with wood floors(waterdamaged though)- we loved. lots of plugs and free internet .. the check in lady was sweet but she was by herself and couldnt help us a couple times. the pool was a little mildewy as was the hot tub, but there were nice towels available.. the bath fixtures fell off when starting the shower--there were clearly bargain basement fixtures. there was no service elevator and a ton of garbage was left by the elevator for at least 4 hrs that i could tell(gross). for $20 more we could have stayed at the intercontinental and been much closer to the mall and restaurants. the limo was fun though! the business center was nice and the breakfast pretty good.. fitness center was and clean and convenient. elevator like a turtle.\n",

But the best features of this hotel hands down was the customer service exhibited by the staff and the Limo service available to guest from 7am until 11pm at no additional charge.

      "  Review : This hotel was, by far, the most accommodating, friendly, and comfortable hotel I have ever stayed at. I was on a business trip, it was my first time in Atlanta, and my stay could not have been more trouble-free. When I arrived late at night, the front desk girl (Marie) was wonderful. Unfortunately, there was a small problem with my room (not important), and Marie was incredibly sympathetic to my need to switch rooms. She quickly got me a different room so that I could go to sleep. The next day, I mentioned that my new room did not have a couch; it was not an important issue, but I did need the couch for the weekend, when my family was arriving to meet me. When I checked back with a gentleman at the front desk (I'm sorry, I've forgotten his name), he moved me into a room with a couch! No questions asked! The rooms were all clean, the walls were nice and sound-proof, the beds were comfortable, and the modern amenities were a fine addition to the experience. I was able to use the pool and the hot tub, which were both clean and clear. The hotel's limousine service was always available (although I did not get the chance to use it), and the driver was very professional and friendly. On top of all that, the continental breakfast was delightful; with bacon, sausage, fresh fruit, yogurt, eggs (scrambled and hard boiled), and an omelet chef, I felt like I was going out to a breakfast restaurant every day. The hotel was also located perfectly for me, as my business was a short, six minute walk from the front door, and a great cantina called \"Tin Lizzy's\" was only about a four minute walk. All in all, this hotel was wonderful, and the staff really made it shine. I really have to mention that Marie (at the front desk) was outstanding, and my only regret was that she was not around more.I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Atlanta, not only the Buckhead area.\n",

I had some issues at check in with my reservation and without a moment's thought the lady at the front desk - and I feel bad i have forgtten her name- helped to fix the problem and come up with a solution. There were many other ways that could have resulted and she made me feel comfortable and welcome. The room was very clean, and large. Plenty of room, to place suitcases, laptops, etc. Anytime I had a question regarding items I had forgotten, how much for a bottle of water, or directions to a restaurant the staff was ready to help. The breakfast in the morning is worth the stay in and of itself. Everything was fresh and the gentleman making omlettes was very friendly and made everything to order. I haven't had the opportunity to use the limo shuttle yet, but was offered the service everytime I was leaving. I look forward to returning on a regular basis.\n",

      "  Review : The Wingate was the hotel headquarters for the recent wedding of our son, and we were the out of town guests. But from the front desk personnel to the housekeeping staff to the breakfast people (custom omelettes cooked in front of you-- just don't expect that with this kind of property) everyone was extremely hospitable and worked to make our stay flawless. The limo service was extensively used, to bridesmaids luncheon and to the church as well as to the reception, and it was a huge help. Room was spacious, well appointed (including places to keep laptop charged, etc). On the Sunday morning after, the breakfast area was filled with wedding guests and we had another chance to visit. Adequate parking, great location-- I would stay there again and I can recommend, from our experience, without hesitation.\n",

      "  Review : From a staff perspective, the Buckhead Wingate exceeded my expectations. From the kind welcome that I received upon my late-night arrival to the assistance provided throughout my stay, the staff truly went above and beyond to ensure that my time at the hotel was as positive as possible. Unfortunately, I had some issues with my room that they could not help, due to a full hotel and an inability to move me, while prevented my time there being all that it could. When I arrived, a full wall of outlets in my room was not working, meaning that some lights did not work and, more significantly, that it was difficult for me to charge my computer, phone, etc. The front-desk staff sent maintenance to see to this issue as soon as I brought it to their attention, and they looked into the issue within 2 hours. Their work resulted in a partial fix that definitely made the stay better. Unfortunately, they were unable to do anything about the noise from the a/c unit in the room. The noise was so loud that it made it difficult to sleep, meaning that I was either awake in a temperate room due to noise or awake in a warm room due to temperature. Again, the staff was incredibly sympathetic to this issue and did everything that they could to make me more comfortable, but, as they could not move me to a different room and said it would be likely that the noise would be present anywhere, were unable to solve the problem despite their best efforts. Apart from these issues, I found the hotel to be well-located and the room to be large, convenient, and clean and would likely recommend it to friends and colleagues or return myself, largely because the staff makes it worth giving the hotel another shot.\n",

The limo they provide was exceptionally helpful and useful for many of our guests as well. Freny, who runs the hotel, was an absolute pleasure to work with and made us feel very well taken care of.

The staff were all friendly and courteous from the desk staff to the maids and waiting staff.Two items set this hotel apart from other hotels we have stayed at in the past. 1) you get a free breakfast buffet. Sure we have stayed at other hotels with \"free breakfast\", but this place had an omelette station and waffle station as well as an assortment of bfast items.2) Their courtesy shuttle( to anywhere in a 3 mile radius) is a stretch limousine. All at no extra cost to you. (we tipped the driver).All in all I would highly recommend this very nice hotel in a truly wonderful city.\n",

I liked that hey had a car available o drive you to dinner within three miles of hotel. Remember to take all f your wn personal items, I ran out of travel size tooth paste and I'd almost $8 for a tube at the hotel. They offer cookies in the reception area, but I would recommend bottled water as a better option. The staff was very friendly and helpful. In my opinion, many of the over the top reviews are exaggerated. It is luxury travel lodge, if that makes any sense. The lil hotel that could. I give them an A for trying.

Breakfast was fine with made to order omeletsSuperior suite has 2 rooms with King bed. Very tight and shades did not have window treatment on the sides so...light came into the room for the person sleeping on the outside wall side.When entering the bathroom room a little critter ran under the tub and was never seen again but set the feeling for the night. Tub was an old, with small jetted holes circa 1950? Water stain in tub by the faucet area and only one sink for 2 people to get ready in such an upgraded room.Floors were substandard as the seams were bubbling or pulling up from a poor installation looked like poor Pergo floor.The bed mattress was FANTASTIC and gave us a restful night of sleep until the sun came up.Overall, not bad; not great but better than average\n",

We lived in Atlanta for over thirty years and never noticed this place. Now that we have moved to the other side of the country, we put together a \"bundled trip\" on Priceline for a visit back to see friends and were placed at this hotel in Buckhead. We could not have been more pleased. The staff is super friendly and eager to help. The full breakfast each morning--complete with a chef who makes made-to-order omelets and waffles--is first rate, the pool is very nice, as is the free business center. Wi-fi works perfectly, and for those without their own transportation, a limo will take you anywhere you would like to go within three miles of the hotel. (That includes Lenox/Phipps shopping centers and an incredible array of some of Atlanta's best restaurants.) The rooms are spacious and clean with large flat-screen TVs. Free cookies every day during happy hour, and a full bar downstairs in the lobby. We will definitely stay here again.\n",

Yes, the beds are comfortable, the breakfasts tasty, the facilities clean and well-maintained, the hot tub and pool delightful, the parking abundant (and free), and the transportation in the stretch limos is outstanding. But what really sets this hotel apart is the staff. This is the kind of \"find\" that makes you grateful for the reviews of other travelers on TripAdvisor. Highly recommended!\n",

      "  Review : This is the place to stay in the Buckhead area. As a return woman traveller I can highly recommend the Wingate as a pleasant, safe and lovely place to stay. A smaller hotel means the staff knows the guests. Rooms are spacious, clean and nicely decorated and the hot breakfast is great. Many thanks to Monique, Chris and Marie for making the stay memorable. Ben drove us from the airport and kept us in stitches the whole way; Craig was a gracious and kind driver throughout the week; housekeeping was excellent. My colleauge and I stayed for four nights and each night we were greeted with, \"Welcome home\" as we returned from a long day at a conference. Thank you everyone! I'll be back again.\n",

      "  Review : My home flooded April 1, 2012 and I had to find accomodations quickly to accomodate me during the renovations. The Wingate gave me a very competetive rate which was great since my stay ended up being nearly 6 weeks instead of the planned 2. I can't say enough about the customer service, the friendliness of the staff, and the quality of the hotel and its amenities. I even was able to secure a \"quiet\" room since this was to be my home for a while: a 5th floor room on the back side of the hotel, away from the elevators. The morning breakfast was wonderful since I couldn't cook for myself and the manager's happy hour was a great way to unwind and have a snack after work. Parking is free and the hotel is very conveniently located. By the time I left, I felt like I was part of the family and I appreciate so much how the staff embraced me and took care of me during such a stressful time. Thank you Burgess, Frannie, Chris, Monique, and everyone else for your warmth and hospitality and for running such a great hotel.\n",

      "  Review : My wife and I drove into town to get away from the teens for a weekend. I just returned from an overseas deployment and wanted a fun weekend with my wife. I chose Buckhead because it is a fun place and chose this hotel because of the past reviews. I liked the hard wood floors, large jacuzzi tub, limo service and front desk folks. The Landmark Diner is a block from the hotel and has an excellent comedy club attached. Ask the front desk for discount coupons for a show. Too, we ate at Hal's Steakhouse...I recommend the filet.I did not like the unprofessional nasty attitude from the lady that worked the breakfast area both days. I think her name was Miss T or something similiar. When you see her, you will know what I mean. Some people have absolutely no business working with people. She should probably be evaluated more closely by management as I do not believe she worked well with the customers nor the other breakfast staff.All in all, the hotel was nice, the desk people were nice and the limo was nice. It was not $200 plus a night nice though. I feel that I paid too much for what was offered and will probably stay elsewhere next time. HAPPY TRAILS!\n",

We wanted to try a different hotel this trip and are glad we did. Wingate at Buckhead is close enough to the business district to be convenient and far enough to be quiet. The staff is led by a manager who leads by example. She and her staff are friendly, helpful, and do what it takes to give good service. I thought we had stepped back in time! The rooms were comfortable, clean, quiet, and beautifully decorated. There were more than enough good choices for breakfast from made-to-order omelettes to fresh carrot/ raisin muffins and all in between. Oh, and fresh cookies every afternoon at 3:00.

      "  Review : My wife and I just enjoyed a 4 day trip to Atlanta. We chose the Wyndham strictly on the basis of reviews on TripAdvisor, and we were certainly delighted with the choice.The hotel -- a lovely large room, clean by even our finicky standards. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom nicely equipped. And it was quiet. The Staff -- Fabulous. They were friendly, helpful, and always upbeat -- always.Downside -- No restaurant. After a day enjoying the sights of Atlanta and battling the horrific traffic, it would have been nice to rest for a bit and enjoy dinner in the hotel. However...There are 5-6 restaurants with a five minute walk of the front door. We tried three of them, and can recommend them for light dinners (salads, soups, sandwiches) -- Zoe's, The Gallery, and Flip Burger (much better than the name suggests). There is also a steakhouse (Hal's?), a Mexican place (Tin Lizzy), and a diner, the name of which I disremember. If you want fancier eats, the hotel offers complimentary limo service to the restaurants in the area (tip the driver, of course)....And...The hotel bar offers a full selection of adult beverages and a pretty good nibbles bar -- salsa and chips, fruit, and a couple of hot items as well.Location -- Buckhead is pretty cool -- and obviously well-to-do. Just car-watching is fun.Major sights (Aquarium, Coca Cola World, CNN Tower, Olympic Park) are 15-20 nerve-wracking minutes away via I-85.An excellent stay, I'd say...excellent!\n",

Well-located near all the restaurants and shopping of Buckhead and I-400, but not so close that it is loud and noisy, the hotel had ample parking, free cookies, and a free breakfast (which we didn't get to eat due to breakfast plans with friends). The room was very nice and clean. Everything worked as you would hope. It was a pleasure to have a hot tub available that didn't close early as it does at many other hotels and a free and easy-to-use business center to look up things to do and check in to flights. I'd definitely recommend this hotel.\n",

      "  Review : Although I haven't stayed in EVERY hotel in Buckhead, I have stayed in a several. I have been traveling to Atlanta on business every week for four months staying three or four days at a time; luckily, early on, I found this wonderful hotel. Cleanliness would be at the top of my priority list for a hotel; this is the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in; exceptionally clean. All of the rooms have hardwood floors, mattresses that are to dream about and faboulous 40-42\" Samsung HD TV with plenty of cable channels. (We like the mattress so much that our next mattress will be exactly the one they have in all of their rooms.) There are never any surprises, everything at this hotel is consistent; I always know what to expect and they never dissappoint. The staff is persistently kind, pleasant, caring and willing to accomodate whatever need may arise; all seem to genuinely enjoy working at this hotel. The hotel is located in an easy access section of Buckhead while still being accessible to all of the desireable Buckhead/Atlanta destinations. The neighborhood is very safe and inviting, we regularly see elderly couples and others out walking and enjoying the outdoors late at night. I honestly cannot think of one thing that could be improved on (which is saying a lot considering how many nights I have spent there). They also have unbelievable coffee......save your Starbucks money for something else. The breakfast is always hot, fresh and delicious. This being the only Wingate Hotel that I have ever stayed in, the bar is definitely set high for the others to follow.\n",

      "  Review : We booked this hotel due to the good reviews on tripadvisor, so I had high expectations when I checked in. I am happy to report the expectations were met and exceeded! We booked 4 rooms in total for our family reunion, with 2 of the rooms checking in 2 days in advance - and the hotel arranged for airport pick-up service (at an additional favorable price) and when my parents who were MIA at Atlanta Airport, Chris at the Front Desk patiently and professionally handled my frantic calls, until my parents were located. The first part of the group thankfully made use of the free Limo service within the 5 mile area, and the kids LOVED it, of course the adults were impressed to. I had expected some older Limo's but in actually they were newer models and quite impressive. It remains crazy though, to arrive at the walgreens in a limo :-) Once our small group was complete, Chris and the entire staff made our stay so personable and easy going - when one family arrived downstairs for breakfast, the staff informed us as to what the other family members were doing - \" they just went back upstairs\" or \"they are sitting outside\" etc etc...Breakfast was MUCH better than the norm, with freshly cooked omelets, waffels and I LOVED the cornbread! Rooms were large and airy with microwaves, fridges, comfy beds and wonderful pillows. One small issue was that there was no handle in the tub/shower at all for my mother to hold on to while taking a shower, so my dad had to assist. The hotel might want to check into this for the future.In my opinion, THE best feature was the FREE expresso, cappuccino and latte machine that the hotel offered throughut the day on the breakfast buffet! I mean Free coffee that tasted better than the leading places that charge you $4.00 a cup!!! So in all, exceptional service, great rates, savings throughout (shuttle, free coffee, free parking) - why would you book anywhere else??!! This hotel has just set the bar in my opinion for other hotels to follow!!!! Good job Wingate!\n",

Love the lack of valet parking, easy in and out for your self parked car and the quieter location closer to Piedmont but a stone's throw from the Lenox complexes. If you want room service and someone to carry your bags in, look elsewhere but if you want to escape the Madding Crowd while being on Roswell at Piedmont close to Lenox Road...book here. Room has comfortable bed, and facilities remain good looking. Microwave and fridge, better breakfast than you deserve at this price point with someone to cook eggs and omelets to order. Coffee that is actually very good and a pleasant dining space. A bar for that evening drink and a decent pool and workout area. Business office that is functional for patrons. The chain also offers discounts for 2 and 3 night stays. This hotel has that something missing elsewhere..a little heart, a well-trained staff and a way to make Atlanta more personal for those needing a place to stay.\n",

Wonderful touch. The location was perfect, the room clean and comfortable. Front desk staff were always helpful and courteous. This is my second time in Atlanta and I am so glad we stayed at Wingate in Buckhead. This location shows a different side to the city with beautiful landscapes and historical buildings.

The staff were extremely friendly, helpful, and professional. My special thanks goes to Chris and Monique at the front desk...I will never forget their friendliness, kindness, and helpfulness. I'm also grateful to the excellent housekeeping staff who cleaned my room beautifully every day. My room was very comfortable complete with a large TV, microwave, refrigerator, coffee maker, and small safe. The beds were luxuriously comfortable, clean, and covered with beautiful comforters and decorative pillows. The bed pillows were so comfy that I asked if I could order two to take home with me. The next day there were two new pillows waiting for me in my room. The common areas of the hotel are also very nice. There is a 24-hour fitness center, business center, and vending room for snacks. The parking was free and very convenient. I always found a parking space next to the building at any time. Since I am originally from Atlanta, I can say with certainty that the Wingate is in a great location, within walking distance of shopping, eats, etc. I will be planning another trip to Atlanta at some point this year and wouldn't consider staying anywhere else but The Wingate in Buckhead.Lisa C.\n",

      "  Review : This was the second time we stayed at the Wingate and it was a pleasant surprise to see the same staff from July 2011. Chris at the front desk recognized us from the time before as did Ben and the breakfast staff. That was a surprise and made us feel welcome. Craig and Ben graciously gave us tours of the houses in Atlanta going to and from our destination. At night the limo took us wherever and was there to pick us up, even at a church when the walk proved to long, excellent service!!The breakfast choices were outstanding and delicious, homemade waffles and omelets to order. All the staff were attentive and friendly making all of us feel welcome. Superb service and staff, beds and all accomodations were first quality, not to mention great price.\n",

      "  Review : We stayed at the Wingate over spring break with our kids. We had a fantastic stay thanks to Alex at the front desk, Greg driving the stretch limo, and F.M. Moore taking care of our breakfast. The staff was extremely accomodating and made every effort to give us the best visit possible. The breakfast was fantastic & the complimentary limo service made our vacation a little more upscale. The property was immaculate and provided for every need. The rooms are beautiful with great beds. It was a great experience for everyone & would stay here again.\n",

      "  Review : My wife and another couple stayed at this hotel during a recent trip to Atlanta. The staff was unbelievably friendly and accommodating and everything was immaculate. Here are the highlights:1. We showed up at 11:30 AM and our room was ready so we got to check in 3.5 hours early!2. The front desk gave us information on how to get around on the MARTA. The stretch Navigator limo shuttle even gave us a ride to and picked us up from the Buckhead station.3. There were free appetizers every night.4. We had a late flight out and were able to check out at NOON instead of 11 AM.If you are going to stay in Buckhead, you will should absolutely stay here. You will not regret it.\n",

      "  Review : We recently stayed at the Wingate-Buckhead for our 4th anniversary. The staff made you feel like you were at a five-star hotel, with their hospitality and attention to detail. We reserved one of the suites with the double-jacuzzi tub, french doors between the bedroom and living room, and the softest bed to relax into.The full, hot breakfast was wonderful, with authentic Belgian Waffles and Omlets, prepared fresh by a live chef with a wonderful personality. Fresh fruit salad, hot biscuits, juice and an expresso machine were just a few of the offerings.Although we did not use the stretch limo (complimentary for guests) during our visit, we are looking forward to touring Buckhead on our next visit.Thank You!\n",

      "  Review : My daughter and I recently stayed at this hotel for a \"fun\" weekend/spring break trip. I chose this hotel because of the neighborhood and the free limo shuttle service. We were not disappointed! The limo was fantastic and my daughter (17 years old) was thrilled!Also the room itself was very good. The beds were exceedingly comfortable and the room was a nice size. Loved the wood flooring and area rug! Very clean and well presented room. My only \"slight\" negative would be that we were put in a room facing Piedmont Road and I would have liked to have been facing the other way because there was a fair bit of traffic noise.The other thing we found VERY impressive was the breakfast in the morning! WOW is all I can say. Lots of selections . . cereals, muffins, breads, fruits, a homemade omelet and waffle station manned by an actual staff member (who was very nice by the way). Also, they had a cappucino and latte machine which I really appreciated.The staff at this hotel were very courteous and gave us great service! We will almost certainly return to this hotel again when we visit Atlanta next time.\n",

      "  Review : I've stayed here twice now in the past couple of months. I don't think you'll find a more pleasant stay in Atlanta for the money. The rooms are clean, nicely appointed and comfortable. The staff is pleasant and very helpful. They go out of their way to serve your needs so that you can just relax while you are there. In the mornings, they have a chef in the dining area to prepare fresh omelets and Belgian waffles while you wait. In the evenings, you really can't beat the complimentary limousine service to get you to and from one of the many great local restaurants in the area (they keep a list at the front desk). Have a drink or two, let them do the driving. It's perfect. The pool is nice, the exercise room is open 24/7 and yes, I'll say it again, the staff is just fantastic.\n",

      "  Review : I was in Atlanta on business and chose the Wingate because of previous reviews I read on trip advisor. Well everything everyone is saying is true. The service was awesome from the front desk, housekeeping to the limo drivers. Image how I felt when the stretch limo picked me up from the MARTA station, open my door and took my bags. But it did not stop there. Every day of my stay at the Wingate the limo drivers made me feel safe and comfortable by driving me to my business meeting and picking me up at the end of the day. “I felt like a celebrity.” Everyone was so kind and courteous. They continually went out of their way to make my stay comfortable. The rooms were very clean and updated. The morning breakfast was fabulous and included freshly made waffles and made to order omelets. I even enjoyed the evening refreshments with the manager. This is probably one of the best hotel stays I have had. Excellent job Wingate-Buckhead! Blessings to all of you for your Service!\n",

Freny made sure a bottle of wine was waiting for us in our room with a hand-written note. Thanks Freny! Everyone is super friendly and accommodating. Chris made dinner reservations for us and provided us with a list of nearby restaurants. Craig took us around in the limo and even opened up the bar early for us one evening. All this plus free breakfast and free parking...which is a big deal in Atlanta. Thank you to everyone for a great stay!\n",

      "  Review : We had a lovely stay at the Buckhead Wingate. The staff was super (Alex, at the Front Desk, was especially helpful) and it was cozy and fun: other guests were friendly, there was a relaxed atmosphere, breakfast and the light evening snacks were great. The pool was private and had comfortable chairs and nice towels. It was great to be off of Peachtree: Piedmont was quieter, and just as close to restaurants and shopping. I really liked the rooms a lot: hardwoods and area rugs felt more homelike, less sterile (though Housekeeping does a great job!). The bed was as comfortable as any Starwood property, and the showers were super. I also loved their soaps/shampoos: I'd never seen them before and they were wonderful. I'm going back to ATL next week -- had usually stayed at Westin, but made reservations for Wingate again.\n",

      "  Review : I spent this past weekend celebrating my daughter's birthday in Atlanta. The rates and reviews were great, and I figured if nothing else, she'd at least get a free limo ride, since it came with the stay. Well I must say everything was perfect. The reviews on this hotel were accurate. This had to be the most accomodating hotel staff that I've ever come across. They even took the time to write out how we could tour the city via the Marta, step by step. The stretch Navigator limo definitely had us feeling like celebrities for a day. The limo will take you anywhere within a 3 mile radius, which includes several eating spots and malls. The rooms were spacious and clean with hardwood floors, and the hotel came with a fitness room, pool, hot tub and business area. The breakfast was the absolute best in town. If for no other reason, I would have stayed there for that. From omelettes, to bacon, sausage, grits, gravy, biscuits, orange juice, apple juice, coffee and the list goes on, but you absolutely must try the waffles. They were the best waffles I've ever had in my life! Enjoy your stay. We sure did!\n",

If you need a hotel oriented to the business traveler, this is your hotel. The service was excellent, the breakfast was good, and the location was very convenient. The business center had everything you would need and if I didn't, I am sure the accommodating staff would help. This place was a few blocks away from bars and restaurants but had a courtesy limousine style shuttle that take you anywhere within 3 miles and pick you up prior to midnight. All said, a great place in Buckhead.\n",

Try Thersa's hot and lemon pepper wings in the lounge! He told us he was the owner and we were kind of shocked. To actually have the hotel owner on the property and take time out open the bar and then socialize with us. They also offer a free stretch limo ride to anywhere within 3 miles of the hotel.

The staff, especially Marquise, were fun and attentive and very helpful in directing you to the hot spots around town. They have a limo on site that will take you anywhere (within a certain radius) and drop you off and then pick you u when you call. The breakfast was very good, including the made-to-order omelet stations, where the server greeted us with a smile and a cheery \"Good Morning\" - Every morning!! Be sure to visit the Coca Cola Museum, Underground Atlanta, take the CNN Studio Tour, go to the Zoo and Aquarium, and don't miss the Civil War Museum, it was Fabulous! Also, be sure to visit the Lennox Mall in case you find yourself needing a new Louis Vuitton handbag, as I did! ;)\n",

They were clean, pleasant and attractive with lovely Oriental-style rugs, firm beds and comfortable chairs. The best part was the staff, however. Mr. LaRue in the breakfast room was kind to our older family members, patient with our young children, and helpful to all. He anticipated what we needed and remembered special things from one day to the next. The wonderful South African bartender was also extremely pleasant and helpful, and moonlighted as an excellent plumber when we had a late night emergency. We couldn't have asked for more! Thank you, Wingate staff, for helping our weekend be such a success!\n",

For example, due to circumstances beyond their control, the workout area was not available to guests. After looking at the workout room and realizing it was not available, a guest walked away, only to be offered by an observant staff person, a day pass to a heathclub! This type of service flowed from the bar tender, to the waitstaff for breakfast, to the cleaning staff and to the front desk and driver! The hotel was clean and all family members stated how much they enjoyed the hard wood floors rather than the usual hotel carpet! The breakfasts were also a family favorite! Highly recommend!\n",

      "  Review : I stayed here last week while on a buying trip to the Atlanta Mart. There were few hotels available in my desired neighborhood by the time I booked and I was somewhat skeptical because, not only was it available and in a good location, but was very reasonable compared to everything else in the neighborhood.Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived to find a larger than normal room with wood floors and an area rug. Since I have allergies, this was a better and more sanitary situation than wall to wall carpet. The bed was nicely appointed, although I would have preferred a lighter separate blanket, rather than the heavy duvet. I also liked having a refrigerator and microwave in the room. Breakfast was good the next morning, loved the custom made omelets and waffles as well as the great latte machine. Although they don't have a dining room, they do have a happy hour in the bar area every evening.The staff was very friendly and helpful even coming to the rescue with a band aid when needed.\n",

(most hotels I end up putting the spare blankets on the bed.) I loved the wood flooring with a plush rug. The staff was great. The clerk that checked me in in the evenings was very kind. The overnight desk guy Alan was always friendly when I saw him early every morning. Such a delight to chat with.\n",

      "  Review : This hotel was clean, convenient, had a great breakfast, and free parking (great for this area of Atlanta). Only negative was that because the rooms have wood floors, you can hear people walking around in the room above you. Also, the walls are thin- we could hear the guest next door snoring! We turned on the AC fan, and it created white noise to drown out the snoring, so not a big deal. I think this hotel is a great value for this area of Atlanta- the breakfast and free parking really make it one step above. However, if you are looking for super luxury (and the price tag that goes with it), check out the Westin and W 3 blocks away.\n",

From the moment you enter, you feel so welcomed by the delicious cookies served and the friendliness of the employees. Marquis is excellent and so helpful with restaurant selections. The front desk is super and the cleaning staff is so helpful and nice. Mr. F.M. and all the people who prepare the buffet each day make sure you have just what you need and in such a kind way. That speaks so highly of them and their job. It is so well done and lovingly prepared and cleaned each day. I appreciate all each one of them does to insure that our stay is so pleasant. You are a winning team and it shows. Keep up the great job you are doing. It is now my GO TO hotel in Atlanta and I will be coming back again in January. Looking forward to a great Home away from home.Thank You so very much.\n",

      "  Review : We visited Atlanta and stayed at The Wingate from Thursday 7th - Sunday 10th October 2010 (despite dated 2011 as date of travel). We arrived from the UK and the hotel arranged for us to be met at Hartsfield Airport and transported to The Wingate in one of their limo's - absolutely fantastic and thanks to Freny for organising. Having been travelling for 10 hours+ this was a great service and meant we did not have the issue of picking up a hire car at the airport or getting a taxi to Buckhead. Check-in was slick and when we got to our room we had a wonderful suprise, with a bottle of bubbly waiting for us as we were celebrating a special occasion. Service at breakfast was exemplorary with an elderly southern gentleman (can't remember his name) really looking after us. The complimentary limo for shopping trips to the mall and out for evening meals into Buckhead is great. We are looking to do another US road trip around the southern states next year and we will be starting that adventure with a stay at The Wingate.\n",

      "  Review : I recently stayed at the Wingate by Wyndham in Buckhead. The only places in Atlanta I've ever stayed are The Ritz Carlton and The W, so I didn't know what to expect. I was blown away by every single aspect of this hotel!!! The location was perfect, first of all. It wasn't on a \"main\" road, like Peachtree or Roswell, so it was easy getting to and from the hotel. Most importantly, the facilities and staff were TOP notch! The manager, Marquis, has an amazing and fun personality! That is key for me because it makes a stay somewhere that much more pleasant. The staff was always kind and willing to help with anything we needed, from restaurant recommendations to friendly inquires about our day. The rooms and bathrooms were so clean, and the suite was only $30 dollars more than a regular room. Each night around 5:30pm, there is a nice selection of complimentary hors d'oeuvres set out and displayed nicely. There is also a nice bar inside the hotel. I loved it! It exceeded mine - and my parent's - expectations! I would MUCH rather stay here from now on, instead of the other \"nice\" hotels. Especially for the price and great customer service! They definitely didn't treat me that kindly at the Ritz!\n",

      "  Review : I was in Atlanta for 5 nights for a convention at the Georgia World Congress Center, downtown, and decided to stay in the Buckhead area. I was looking for a hotel along the lines of a Wingate, Hampton, Courtyard etc.., and chose the Wingate based on price and previous reviews. I made the right choice!!Check in was quick and easy, and was with the \"Legandary\" Marquis. The room was good, and looked exactly as advertised in photos. The room had a King bed, large flatscreen TV, small fridge and microwave, sitting chair, desk, and a bathroom with lots of counter space. I had a problem with the in room safe the first night and the problem was fixed within 20 minutes. There was a little mechanical room hum at night but it did not affect my sleep. Breakfast was very good, (Eggs, bacon, sausage, grits, omelets, waffles) and the breakfast staff was very friendly to all of the customers. The only mistake that I made was deciding to have breakfast one day at the Waffle House down the street, instead of the hotel. The hotel was much better! The commute downtown only took 30 minutes in rush hour. The METRA station is about a mile away if needed. Buckhead is a great place to stay with several places to eat, entertain, and shop. If anyone is comming to Atlanta and needs a great place to stay at a reasonable rate,the Wngate is the place to stay!!\n",

You can walk there in about five minutes. It was the worst food I've had in quite a while. There are a lot of good restaurants in Atlanta but that is not one of them.\n",

So light sleeper should perhaps bring earpliugs.The breakfast buffet was top notch, it even sported an omelette and waffle station where a cook prepared everything according to our wishes.A small, but nice gym was also available.A nice perk is the limo-service. The hotel has a small fleet of Lincoln Navigator stretch limos that provide free transportation within a 3mile-radius, i.e to the nearest MARTA-station or to Lenox Square Mall, a very posh shopping center.\n",

      "  Review : We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in a king suite last week. Chris was exceptionally helpful at the front desk. Two hotel limos will take you and pick you up from shopping or dinner within a small radius of the hotel. There's late afternoon/early evening munchies as well as hot cookies available. A chef prepares made to order omelettes for breakfast (which is served later than most hotels on a weekday), and the breakfast offerings are excellent. The building maintenance engineer came within 5 minutes of our call to Chris and helped us. In short, Southern hospitality is alive and well in Georgia at the Wingate in Buckhead. The suite was spacious and comfortable, hard floors and not carpet, and the extra large separate shower and extra large tub felt luxurious after being on our feet while visiting Carter and MLK museums all day. We ordered Greek food from a nearby restaurant which delivered and enjoyed very good food.\n",

      "  Review : My husband and I just got married in another state and traveled to Atlanta because that's where he is currently working (we live out of state). We wanted a \"honeymoon suite,\" but most of all I wanted a canopy bed. After looking online, we saw that Wingate has a canopy bed and called to confirm (they have two). We were quoted a discounted price on the phone, and when we arrived we wanted to check out the suite before we committed. The front desk clerk called the bar tender to show us the room. Both men were nice and friendly. We ended up booking the suite for 4 nights (Wed-Sat). We also liked the fact that they had complimentary limo service, but we never used it. The room was warm when we went in and we promptly turn the units on cool--there is one in the sitting area and one in the bedroom. I would have liked to have air in the bathroom so we didn't have to leave the bathroom door open all the time to get it cool in there. I was disappointed that there were no robes or slippers, but that's no big deal, just a luxury I thought would be nice to have. I liked the hard-floors and the rug in the sitting area. The sitting area was spacy, the couch was stiff but that's typical of hotels, and the TV was huge (I wish there were more than 37 channels and maybe PPV). They didn't have room service, which is okay but again would have been a nice luxury to have. We ordered in one night and needed some eating utensils and a corkscrew, and the front desk was happy to help us out. The bedroom had limited space because it was only slightly larger than the king size canopy bed. They also had a bench, dresser with TV, a floor lamp, and a nightstand with lamp in the room. The canopy bed was so neat (first time I've ever slept in one) but I do wish the hanging mesh fabric left something to be desired--they need to switch it with a more elegant fabric to match the elegant bed. I loved sleeping on the bed, everything about the sheets, blankets, pillows were great. I felt like a princess. The window had a blackout shade too, but it was broken and couldn't be pulled up to get sunlight. Now on to the bathroom...It was very spacious (which we appreciated). They had awesome toiletries that went beyond our expectations (we don't normally see bath salts, q-tips, cottonballs in hotel bathrooms). It had a free standing, spacious shower, but the 3-setting showerhead was leaking around the connection. The bathroom also had a large spa (jacuzzi!) tub. It was awesome, except that the handheld showerhead on the bathtub looked old and was cracking, which caused water to shoot out everywhere when you used it--that wasn't a big deal to us so we just simply didn't use it. So about the cockroach...it was in our bathroom on Friday, (the the third day after the second night). We slept in and woke up at 12:30pm, went to the bathroom, saw and killed the roach, and then decided to pack our stuff and check out and change hotels. This roach was about 1.5-2 inches long, very large. Roaches are absolutely intolerable, and I thought that by staying in a nice hotel that we would not have to worry about them. We explained our situation to the front desk clerk, who asked us why we didn't report it before 11am (checkout time). We were kind of dumbfounded by that, but explained again that we slept in and found it around 12:30pm. She said she would not charge us for Friday (I would hope not!). I asked if she could discount our two nights and she got the manager. By that time the lobby was filling up and he took us to a meeting room to discuss our issue. He was very nice and happy to discount our 2 nights by $75. We went down the street to the Hampton Inn and booked a standard king room...I wasn't happy with the sheets and asked for new ones and they were happy to promptly accommodate me and even gave us the first night for FREE. Hampton knows how to take care of their guests a bit more than Wingate.\n",

      "  Review : After reading the reviews, I booked a room here for a special occasion. I was disappointed, and embarrassed after I had told my mom that we were staying at a really nice place while in Atlanta to celebrate her special occasion. It's hard to imagine that this place is ranked #2 by tripadvisor writers over all hotels in Atlanta. The stay wasn't bad, but it was nothing too special either. The Embassy Suites down the road is far better and a bit cheaper. Wish I had stayed there. The hotel is fine, no major complaints. It's just not special. It looks a bit dingy and ordinary when driving up. The lobby is the best part. I suppose are impressed by the wooden floors in the rooms....as long as the person in the room above them isn't clomping around on it at 3am....as we experienced. We had an \"oversized\" room, but it looked like the normal size to me. The beds were literally, double beds, as advertised. For the price, I would have expected the beds to be a tiny bit larger. The linens were super nice. The pool area needs a serious power washing. Not inviting at all. And it constantly had leaves in it, making it look dirty. But with the trees surrounding it so close by, I guess it's hard to keep the leaves out. I was so looking forward to sitting in the pool area while I visited with family that I see once a year, but we decided to spend more time away from the hotel since it wasn't all that nice. The breakfast is great. The one man cooking all the omelets and waffles is amazing, considering the huge crowd he was serving. The staff were really nice, but not so knowledgeable about the area, surprisingly enough. They had difficulty recommending a nice place to eat lunch nearby (other than burgers and Mexican food), as well as where to go for night life in the area. So, overall, it's a pretty good hotel, but don't go there expecting anything fancy.\n",

We took the train from the airport. Every landmark in Atlanta was easily accessible by train. The breakfast was magnificent. The free hordoevres at dinner were excellent.

      "  Review : This was our first stay at this hotel. We absolutely loved it! The hotel is beautiful, the location is great and the staff is simply amazing especially the Manager Marquis. It's close to area attractions, however away from the hustle and bustle. We in town for a family memeber's wedding and we ended up feeling like we were on our honeymoon. Upon check-in, the Manager greeted us with a smile, by our names and with warm fresh baked cookies. :) Great referral by the Manager and limo driver for dinner. We enjoyed a limo ride to the Atlanta Fish Market. (Can you say... yum, yum, and more yum.) Our room was spacious, well decorated and very clean and comfortable. In all of my travels, I have never had a complimentary breakfast so wonderful. The chef was attentive and very friendly. Marquis, you were right.. It knocked my socks off. :) This will be our new Atlanta home away from home. Thank you for your hospitality. Sincerely, Mr. & Mrs. Smith\n",

The rooms are very comfortable and very clean. The breakfast served is second to none for complimentary breakfasts I have had. The Buckhead area is very tourist friendly and I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the Atlanta area. Access to downtown is quite good also.\n",

      "  Review : Was here for two weeks in June 2011 for business. I chose it for two reasons. First near to my office and second the complimentary limo service within a certain mile radius. All the staff was very attentive and friendly. To mention some names, the limo drivers Farris, Ben, Craig and of course the staff at the reception and not to forget the cook (sorry, I cant remember the name). Only breakfast is served here but that was no problem for me. Will stay here again the next time I am in Atlanta.\n",

      "  Review : My husband and I enjoyed the breakfast. The food was delicious and the chef was cheery and friendly. The hotel was clean and the bed was comfortable. There is a little shop with snacks and drinks that was convenient after a long day out. Our only complaints: the free wifi was only available in one corner of the room. We couldn't sit in bed and surf. The cable went out on us so we couldn't watch tv that night. We waited by the empty front desk for assistance and, after several minutes, someone spotted us from across the room and said someone would be with us soon, then disappeared. We had already had a long day of \"service malfunctions\" I'll say, so we just went to the room. Any close-up interactions with staff were pleasant, though. The Buckhead area is nice and has some good eats and shopping. We would probably stay here again.\n",

      "  Review : This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at, and I travel a lot for work. Just a few of the highlights that set it apart: Hardwood floors in the guest rooms, which felt much cleaner than the nasty old carpet at many hotels. Extremely luxurious bedding, including a down comforter in a cover and a variety of pillows. Nice TV with a special remote control that can be sanitized. Excellent water pressure in the shower and nice toiletries (including nail file!). But what really impressed me was the HOT breakfast, with made-to-order waffles and omelettes, biscuits and gravy, grits, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, good cereal selection, yogurt, juices, toast and other pastries, and an espresso machine. And none of this was your average hotel fare -- this was food comparable to a decent restaurant. The location is perfect for exploring Atlanta, and they have complimentary limo service. Overall a great experience and I will definitely stay there again when I visit Atlanta.\n",

      "  Review : We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights while we were visiting family in Atlanta. It was the first time we have stayed at a Wingate and we will look for Wingates from now on! Loved everything about the hotel. The only slight problem is the check-in person asked if we preferred a quiet room, which we did. He gave us one overlooking the pool, I think 3 or 4 floors up. Had a very noisy group drinking out by the pool (until we went down after 11pm and asked the check-in person to have them move inside.) I think I would opt for the street side of the this hotel next time. Other than that - perfect stay al around!\n",

      "  Review : I recently had the pleasure to stay at this hotel over a recent holiday weekend. The occasion was a wedding and over 30 rooms were booked for the wedding weekend. The staff was the friendliest staff I have ever met. From all my pre-wedding phone calls to staying with them for 5 nights, no question or request was ever a bother. From the true southern gentleman who made delicious waffles and omelets, to the front desk staff who went out of their way to make sure all the guests were comfortable, and to the limo driver (provided by the hotel at no charge) who put up with endless trips around Buckhead. Each guest was met with a warm smile when checking in and when handed a wedding Welcome Bag! And Marquis, the manager, was the best! He was a true delight to work with. Thank you Marquis and staff for making the wedding weekend (despite the rain) a most wonderful experience! I will be back!!!!!\n",

We appreciated the microwave and fridge in our room, a chair for sitting other than a desk chair and wood laminate floors rather than tired broadloom. Very comfy beds. The breakfast was good with an option for made-to-order omelettes- a bonus for an 'included' breakfast. But best of all we found the staff to be very friendly and very helpful for any request we had. For example, one of our party unexpectedly needed to seek some medical help nearby and the hotel offered to take her to and from her in the hotel shuttle- so much appreciated.

      "  Review : As others have commented, the staff was overall very friendly and helpful. Chris at the reception was very helpful and patient with my dozen or so questions about places to eat on a Sunday night after I checked in. Provided several good recommendations. The limo is a nice touch. Allowed me to enjoy a few adult beverages with dinner and have my own designated driver. My room (king bed) was ample size and well-kept. I thought is wa a nice touch that instead of standard industrial carpeting that you see in most hotels, this room had vinyl flooring (looked like wood) with a wonderful oriental rug. Nice sitting area with lamps, and a good work area with both wired and wireless internet access. 40\" or size flatscreen was great to watch the MLB All-Star game on!Cleanliness of the room and facilities was outstanding. Breakfast was fairly basic and while I have no complaints with it all, it is not one of the strong points. Standard eggs-bacon-sauage plus biscuits and gravy and a small choice of healthy options (yogurt, fruit). On 2 of my 3 mornings there, they were making omelettes to order and these were quite good. The staff at breakfast were always friendly and polite, a nice way to start the day!The fitness center and pool were small but adequate. Again, not their strongest points but nothing I would complain about.I travel to Atlanta a couple of times a year for business and this will be where I stay whenever I can.\n",

Members of my group utilized the limo service to the mall - they were quite pleased. The breakfast was delicious! Whomever was working the front desk whenever I walked in - no matter the hour - welcomed me warmly. It really is the customer service that makes this hotel - from the first phone call, chatting up the limo driver, talking with the morning chef, seeing the smiles of the front desk personnel. The room? I enjoyed the hardwood floors in the room - much better than carpet (why don't all hotels do this?). Everything was clean - the beds were comfy - I have ZERO complaints. If you need a place to rest your head in Buckhead - definately make it a Wingate stay!\n",

I wasn't quite sure what to expect and I ahve to say we were pleasantly surprised! The front desk manager, Marquis, was very friendly, courtesous and helpful. The hotel is centrally located, just down the road from the 400 interstate. Great location in Buckhead to restaurants, shopping and nightlife. The room is a good size, they offer a breakfast buffet included with your room rate, they ahve a biz center, small pool, complimentary stretch Navigator limo for use within 3 miles. The tub is very small - smaller than what I ahve in my home, actually the bathroom is on the small side too but again, for the price point... you can't beat it. One wird thinjg was the window coverings didn't cover the window all the way, there was openings on the side, so no matter what you do, you will have light streaming in.... no true black out drapes or total darkness if you're trying to sleep in.\n",

The hotel helped arranged all our activities and allowed us to use their limos to transport our group of 30 + to dinner at a nearby location. The rooms were clean and nicely decorated with free wifi. I travel a lot for business so if I were in Atlanta I would definitely make this my first choice. If you are visiting you can't beat the location since Buckead is one of the nicer neighborhoods in Atlanta, you have countless options for eating and shopping. But the best part of the hotel is the staff, they are just nice people willing to help with a smile. The Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta - Buckead is definitely the best option in Atlanta. Their rates are reasonable as well, they could charge an additional hundred dollars and it would still be a good deal.\n",

There are so many wonderful things about this place, but most importantly is that we felt like we were at the Ritz for a fraction of the cost. This is true pampering on a budget!We loved the free, on-call limo service (a huge stretch SUV) that would drop us off and pick us up from restaurants or anything else within a reasonable radius. The rooms were honestly gorgeous. Love the hardwoods/laminate rather than icky carpet.The staff was incredibly nice and knowledgeable and had tons of dining options at their fingertips, would make reservations for us and even give us coupons for free aps!One night we walked just a bit down the street to a super swanky and incredibly delicious--if pricey--restaurant (I've forgotten the name, but I want to say it was Harry's or Harvey's? Just ask the front desk about the steakhouse down the street.) Overall, I would stay here again in a heartbeat. This place is great for everyone: couples, families, etc.\n",

The decor is pretty, it's clean, and even though we were next to the elevator we found it very quiet. The beds and bathroom are very comfortable too. We had a small problem with the toilet (nothing major) and called to report it upon checking out. As we were literally walking out the door to leave there was a repairman ready to get working on it. The free brunch is one of the best I've had. There was a cook both mornings making waffles and omelets and if you didn't like that there was bacon, sausage and scrambled eggs besides the usual pastries, bread, bagels, cold cereal, yogurt and fruit. Marquise, thanks for being so attentive. I would stay there again without any hesitation if I needed to.

From walking though the door to the lovely lobby, and gracious staff, to the comfortable room; this hotel has it all. My extended family visited us for the evening and we enjoyed a chauffered ride to Lenox Square for dinner. The girls were quickly putting up posts that they were taking a limo ride and took photos with Craig, who had a wonderful sense of humor about the whole thing. The morning breakfast served to order by F.M., aka, the southern gentleman, was delicious. His omelettes and waffles were delicious, as was his charm. The rooms were well-appointed and we were thoroughly relaxed by the end of our stay. During the evening, the light in the bathroom began to flicker. After a quick phone call someone came up to take care of it, then the next morning, another staff member came by to make sure that we didn't have any other issues. Which we didn't. We will definitely stay again when we are in the area.\n",

      "  Review : The staff at this hotel make you feel special and will help you, no matter what the question.Amongst the friendliest and most helpful are the dynamic duo at the front desk, the lovely Monique Smith whose smile is only as great as her great personality. Her side-kick on the front desk is the well-dressed Marquis Davis with his sense of southern charm & humor & vast GQ wardrobe. Of course speaking of Southern Hospitality it's true Southern Gentlemen, Chef R.M., who will whip-up some of the finest Omelettes at the breakfast table. After a long day of business in downtown ATL, the bar and pool at the Wingate are a pleasant respite. Chief Bar mixologist Etienne, a passionate cave diver, will prepare a host of many original cocktails., Ask him to create one of his famous Martinis; especially the ones with the exotic Wild Hibiscus flowers from Australia. He is well schooled in the fine Bourbons of Kentucky and stocks some of the best Tequila. \"E\" as everyone calls him, remembers your name, your cocktail and will ensure that your stay is relaxing. He serves free hors d'oeuvres and pizza at cocktail hour.\n",

      "  Review : My first stay in a Wyndham hotel was in Destin ,Fl the hotel was nice and so was the breakfast. However, My family and I stayed at the one in Atlanta, buckhead when we first walked in , the hotel had a stale smell. the lady at the counter was nice. But, when we got to our room the bathroom had a terrible smell, we had to ask for some spray but it did not work. the pillows was not comfortable. to make matters worse, we gave the lady at the first desk the credit card we wanted them to use however, she use the WRONG card if I didnot check my account I could have over drafts on it. the manager was not there and the lady stated he will be in tommorrow. I feel like they didnot care if I had overdrafts on my account, which were there FAULT. I would not recommend coming to this hotel at Buckhead.\n",

      "  Review : This was a very special trip I was planning as a belated birthday present to myself. My favorite Comedienne Chelsea Handler had rescheduled her show and my husband & I were available to come to the show. I searched for hotels nearby and this one popped up. I over looked it at first because it was a bit pricey, but upon calling some of the other hotels I would \"usually\" stay at on a trip, I wasn't very happy about some of the extras I wanted. I called the Wingate and spoke with Marquis Davis, Guest Services Manager. I explained to him I was in town for the Chelsea show and also wanted to add on a romance package. He was super nice to speak with on the phone, took my reservations, told me not to worry about a thing, and since Chelsea was performing at the Chastain Park Amphitheater there would even be shuttle transportation for us there. He also gave me the website to look for our gift coupon to the restaurant of our choice to go with our Romance package. We first were going to stay from fri-sun, but because we were able to get a v.i.p ticket to Chelsea's book signing on Friday and it was to start at 3:00 pm, i called and add thursday night 07/21 to our trip. I must say, I believe that Marquis, Chris and I either spoke on the phone or I emailed through the hotel email about questions that I had that kept popping up. I wanted to go to a salon, Marquis suggested a great one, Stewart & Company, my husband wanted to see a movie, they suggested the AMC fork & screen, Marquis had Mapquested the directions I needed to get to the book signing, they booked and changed our dinner reservation (we couldn't decide on a time.) I was made to feel like the most special guest in the world and also as if i were the only one staying here. Marquis and Chris, both went above and beyond customer service. They were EXCEPTIONAL. Then I had a crisis, The book signing had been rescheduled from 3 pm to 5 pm to 6 pm (concert started at 8 pm & our shuttle would be leaving around 7 to get us there on time.) So once again, I went to the front desk to see Marquis. He told me \"Settle down sweetie, we will handle this\". so he found a friend driver from a taxi service and made that driver promise to take me to the book store, wait for me at the book store and then get me to chastain park so I could see my show. The taxi driver got us to the book store, chelsea showed up about 10 minutes early, I had a low ticket number, we were out of there in like 20 minutes, so I asked the driver to just take me back to our hotel so we could shuttle with the rest of the guests. Of course Marquis looked surprised when we arrived back, but when he found out everything was wonderful, he was relieved. The concert went off as planned. The shuttle took us to the salon but was booked for an airport ride so we had to get a taxi from the salon to the closest mall around there, but our shuttle picked us up from the mall, took our purchases back to the hotel and dropped us off at the AMC fork & screen for our movie, picked us up from the movie and took us & picked us up from the dinner as well. Everything that I thought was going wrong, was IMMEDIATELY handled by the staff and once we got there, I literally worried about nothing. The hotel was majestic, the breakfast wonderful and the stocked bar entertaining. I loved the wireless & wired internet and the t.v.s as well. but I will tell you, because I was treated like royalty when I'm just a girl from Alabama, I am recommending THIS hotel and this staff to all of my family and friends and everyone I know, because our stay was AMAZING!!! Thanks again!!!!!!\n",

Everything was perfect and a special mention for the breakfast and the on-hand chef making fresh waffles and omelettes. It's not in the centre of town but if that doesn't matter to you then don't go anywhere else.\n",

      "  Review : It's not the Ritz Carlton or the Four Seasons (hence the 4 star rating and not a five) but it's a very comfortable hotel for the money. Staff was very accommodating and helpful -- suggesting attractions to see and places to eat (even made reservations for us). Has free limousine service available for trips within 3 miles of hotel -- easily gets you to the MARTA station. Offers a free breakfast with a chef who will cook made-to-order waffles and omelettes. Close to Lenox and Phipps malls - great shopping! Would certainly stay here again.\n",

Craig was the limo driver for the FREE shuttle service and is such a kind,special person. We really enjoyed talking with him. Marquise of course is legendary, and was just as personable and helpful as we had expected. There is free parking and internet service as well. We have stayed at many pricier hotels and not received anywhere near this level of service. If you are traveling anywhere near this area you will be happy to be a guest of this hotel.

Our trip was made especially memorable because of Marquis Davis, Guest Services Manager. Marquis truly made us feel like family; his professionalism and sense of humor are unmatched. We also thought Craig; the driver was fantastic, and very friendly. We would definitely stay at this clean hotel again the next time we travel to Atlanta!\n",

      "  Review : My mother and I came for a conference in Downtown Atlanta and after all the wonderful reviews decided to stay at the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta-Buckhead. The hotel is FABULOUS and the staff including maid service were all wonderful and very helpful. A very special \"Thank You\" to Marquis for going the extra mile with customer service, he is truly a rare gem and we were honored to meet him. Southern Hospitality is not dead by any means at this wonderful hotel. We never got a chance to take the courtesy stretch SUV for a ride around the area, but it was there everyday and all of the guests that I spoke to said it was INCREDIBLE. The hardwood floors, microwave, refrigerator, swimming pool and fitness center were exquisite. Free parking and Free internet access made our stay that much more enjoyable. The made to order omelets and waffles along with the buffet breakfast each morning were the icing on the cake. The hotel is also very close to the highway, restaurants, financial institutions and also two large shopping malls. THANK YOU for an awesome stay. We'll be back again, and again and again!!!\n",

We make it our expectation to stay in boutique properties around the US, but our fav spots were booked at this last minute getaway. As avid TA followers, we were intrigued with the #1 TA rating...compared to stays at Ellis, Palomar, W, Glenn...what a steal and what a fabulous stay for our anniversary! Cheers,\n",

We were able to check in early and given all the helpful information without asking. Our room was beautiful with the best of complimentary items. Suggestions and reservations were made by staff for dinner; both times an excellent meal. A very charming man made our breakfast each morning.After our stay at another large chain with terrible food and a rude indifferent staff the Wingate was an absolute pleasure. Also had the honor to meet the legendary Marquis.It's all about customer service and these people have it; they really seem to enjoy the people. Almost forgot the wonderful cookies!!\n",

      "  Review : We used ratings and comments in Trip Advisor to book our first family vacation, and were not disappointed. At Wingate in Buckhead, we were made to feel comfortable, at home, and appreciated. How refreshing- a business willing to give proper customer service! They have our business!I wish we could remember more names but the ENTIRE staff was warm and very friendly. Marquis and others were polite, fun, and went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed the hotel amenities. Excellent hot breakfast, evening snacks, limo service, rooms, location, FREE parking, ectcetera. Downtown Atlanta was less than 15 minutes away. Buckhead was a nice area with many nearby restaraunts and a AAA ofice minutes away. Stretch Escalade was convenient and a treat. Travelling with 2 toddlers was made alot more manageable! Fridge and micro in the room was also very helpful.As important as amenities were to our choice of hotel, how we were treated was so lovely and made for a memorable hotel stay in Atlanta. We highly recommend Wingate Buckhead, and would stay again without question. Thank you for a great family vacation!\n",

      "  Review : My company puts us up at the Wingate in Buckhead fairly regularly. I always love coming here because the staff is so great, the rooms are so clean/nice, the breakfast is good and free, and the location is perfect.Everyone at this hotel makes me feel welcome every time I come here. The staff always greets me by name and the check-in/out process is painless and very quick. There is a small gym with a treadmill and a multi-station machine. The outdoor pool and hot tub are always clean and a nice break after a workout. Housekeeping is efficient and will not bother you if the DND sign is up on your door. When they do come in, they do a great job with the rooms.The hotel is in Buckhead and is within walking distance to some great restaurants, a grocery store and a mall. It's also only a mile from CrossFit BTB Fitness, which is a great place to workout while you're in town.The hotel is also convenient to GA-400 and I-85. Oh yeah, they also have two stretch-limos for you to use for FREE (Tip the drivers if you use them - $5-$10 each way is what I have given in the past). Free wired and wireless internet in your room.Great hotel to stay in for business or for families.\n",

      "  Review : Where do I start...., well let's just say we didn't want it to end!!!!! LOL My family and I would like to rate this hotel above 5 stars! We chose to stay at this hotel to celebrate our matriarch’s 76th birthday and also, because of our experiences in the past with other hotel chains. I will tell you HONESTLY, what made our stay so different this time compared to other national chains, is the fact that they ALL can basically offer your family nice amenities, a bed and a room key, but from the moment we all walked in the hotel until the time we checked out we were greeted with such an unexpected warm welcome!!! Especially from Marquis Davis the guest services manager!!!! With the scent of freshly baked cookies and a beautiful smile and personality, he and the Wingate staff made us all feel like we had just walked into a little part of heaven! They did everything to make us know, as they showed us that they cared! Quite frankly, it’s not every day average people get to ride in an upscale, well-equipped, clean, black and polished Lincoln Navigator stretched limousine. Which also was driven by one of the most professional and punctual drivers!!!! The entire hotel was very clean, inside and out, the grounds were well manicured everything was beautifully decorated with a touch of Southern charm and elegance, very well organized. Also, the ambiance of the lobby and dining area was amazing! The choice of warm colors, an array of healthy indoor plants, beautiful drapery, window treatments, and the layout of the furniture made it comfortable for us to sit together and enjoy each other as a family for conversation and photos. The rooms were spacious and beautifully decorated as well, quiet and so comfortable until we all slept like babies! Lastly, breakfast time was awesome because they offered an assortment of hot and cold breakfast favorites. We will definitely revisit this hotel again and the only problem we had was saying goodbye! Thanks Wingate Atlanta-Buckhead for making our experience memorable for our family especially for our mother!\n",

      "  Review : My husband and I spent four nights at the Wingate with our two small children. We could not be happier with the experience.Rooms: The rooms were very clean and spacious. We stayed in a Grande Suite with a king sized bed and pull-out sofa. It was perfect for our small family as it had doors that separated the bedroom from the living area (perfect for afternoon naps). The room had a microwave, refrigerator, and sink - an absolute must with bottles for the baby. The bathroom was oversized with a jacuzzi tub and separate shower. Breakfast: The free breakfast was a nice perk. There were hot and cold options which were delicious! The chef made omelets and waffles to order...very yummy!Service: This was, by far, the best part of the hotel. The staff was courteous and willing to help in any way possible to make sure our stay was comfortable. A special thank you to our housekeeper, Rosa, who had to clean around a mess of baby items every day! I can't say enough about the entire staff at Wingate. From making the reservation to check out, they truly made our trip a wonderful one. We are so grateful we chose to stay here.We would highly recommend a stay at the Wingate!\n",

It was so nice not to have navigate Atlanta traffic at night after a full day of work!Every staff member I met was personable, friendly and very helpful! The free breakfast included not only the typical continental breakfast items, but a chef to cook you an omelet or fresh waffles each morning!I was most impressed with the quality, cleanliness and decor of all of the rooms, both public and private.

      "  Review : Best hotel in Buckhead, period. I travel to Atlanta almost monthly for business, and have tried quite a few different hotels in Buckhead and none really compare to the Wingate. The Grand Suites are outstanding for the money you spend. (Ex. I had to stay at the Grand Hyatt for one night as the Wingate was sold out. The Hyatt's room was tiny, no free breakfast AND $30 to park!! All in all, I spent MORE than I would have spent for my nice suite at the Wingate.) I can't even believe there is one negative review for this hotel. Honestly - I have no reservation in recommending this hotel for anyone staying in Buckhead (for business or pleasure). This is a top notch hotel, great staff, comfy rooms, wonderful breakfast, and great location.\n",

I have stayed here many times since 2010 and I have never been disappointed. I think their staff is the most friendly and helpful of any hotel I have ever stayed at from the maids to the front desk to the management. The rooms are clean, the beds is very comfortable, there are big screen digital tv's in every room. It is in a great location for shopping and food. Every room has a microwave, and refrigerator. I do wish they had a better fitness room but it is adequate and has a treadmill, elliptical, bike and some weight equipment. It has a 24 hour pantry that is packed with snacks and drinks and candy. They offer snack food every night like meatballs, cheeses, fruit, vegetable with dip, chicken wings, chips and salsa and other stuff. The meats are changed every night like wings, meatballs, wrapped mini hotdogs, and other warmed snacks. The breakfast is awesome. They will even make you an omelet if you have time. They usually have bacon, grits, scrambled eggs, sausage, fruits, breads, pastries, etc. You will get your money worth here and it is a great place to stay. The value is great. They also have free wireless internet in the rooms.\n",

      "  Review : Stayed here for 5 nights on a roadtrip from London. Hotel matched the price from priceline.com so meant it was easier to book. Monique at front desk was very helpful. Additionally, Marquis is definitely a star!! Chris was also very attentive. The whole Wingate experience is about personalisation and they appreciate you staying there. Very friendly and attentive service allround. Marquis received my party very well. The Limo's well you do feel like a star rolling up at the local restaurants in a limo!! There are two so always got a ride when we wanted. Even one time, when another was being used for a an airport pick-up, they got the duty manager to drive the other one especially for us. Ferris and the taller gentleman who is a Limo driver, were always there to help us on and off. Location is perfect for Atlanta, you just get a ride to the Marta and can go to central Atlanta where a lot of the attractions are situated. All the staff are very friendly, even the room attendants always had service with a smile, even when passing by. The breakfast was lovely, made to order omelettes and waffles were delicious! Mr Moore the Chef did so much, the cooking, cleaning tables, helped a lady who couldn't walk unaided with bringing her coffee, directions to places etc...a real gentleman. The fully equipped rooms are larger than the average hotel room, modern matching furnishings, lovely firm beds, with flat screen TV's, a fridge and microwave, tea and coffee making facilities (they were also in the in lobby along with lovely iced water with either lemon or lime, so refreshing after coming in from the sun), iron and board and hairdryer, lovely toiletries. At the front desk, the freshly baked cookies, all types were scrummy too, another extra of this hotel. Pool is lovely at the back of the hotel, so secluded, great for a dip. Free parking also is plentiful. This hotel is definitely one that others can learn from, I have stayed in all types of hotels from 1 to 7 stars and this one is definitely in a class of its own. Would love to stay here again! God bless you all!\n",

      "  Review : Just returned from a 5 day stay at this hotel. The rooms are beautiful and spacious with very comfortable beds. The free made to order breakfast is wonderful. The best part of this hotel, however, is the staff. You are made to feel like family the instant you walk through the front door. Marquis, the manager at the front desk is awesome. He took care of all of our needs. Chris, another person who worked at the front desk was so wonderful also. He recommended restaurants for us and took care of all of the arrangements. Craig, our limo driver, was totally awesome too. He took us through the beautiful neighborhoods of Buckhead, drove us anywhere we needed to go, and was a true gentleman, always making sure we were taken care of. My work colleagues and I wish we could have stayed forever, or at least bottled up some of that southern hospitality and taken it back home with us to Minnesota. The staff at the Wingate are truly experts in customer service!\n",

      "  Review : First time to Atlanta area, and first time staying at a Wingate hotel. I was expecting a comfortable bed, satisfactory service, & average accommodations, but what I received was so much more! From the time I booked my reservation til the time of check out (a two week period) I felt like I was walking into a personalized hotel, rather a home away from home. The customer service is incredible, fresh breskfast w/ omelet station, not the typical continental style here, snacks during evening hours, limo style shuttle service, and the location is walking distance to so many great restaurants. I wish all hotels were like this!\n",

      "  Review : We were in Atlanta for the first time for our son's commencement ceremony at Emory. We experienced an uncommon sense of community during our stay at the Wyngate in Buckhead. We made some new friends here that we will keep in touch with and met so many wonderful people from around the country.  This property lacks the \"franchise feel\" that you experience with most hotels. The layout and the amenities create an environment conducive to conversation. The tables and chairs out by the pool, a very small and classy bar in the lobby allow for both business and pleasure to be conducted. A quiet and comfortable venue all the way around.  Our room was large and inviting with hard wood floors, granite counter tops, a marble shower, a huge flat screen and a nice reclining chair. The beds were amazing. We did not hear other guests during our stay.  This hotel offers hot entrees at a breakfast bar, with \"custom omelets.\" Monday, we were greeted by a smiling chef decked out in the complete chef attire. The hot breakfast at 6 a.m. was quick and just what we needed when it was time to head to the airport for our long return flights to Oregon. Many choices including fruit, muffins biscuits and gravy. We were glad to be in Buckhead. We spent time in Decataur, Midtown and Druid Hills and this hotel is a short drive to all of these areas.  The staff at the hotel in Buckhead is phenomenal. Every need is taken care of and in a timely manner. They exceeded our expectations in every area. It was an important family event for us and this hotel was the perfect choice for our stay.\n",

      "  Review : We stayed here while visiting family and the staff could not be more accommodating. So friendly.By far, the cleanest rooms I have ever stayed in. Came back to the room while the cleaners were cleaning one morning and they even were polishing the doorframe! The attention to detail is above par.Great location and even though we did not use the complimentary limo, had we stayed another few days, we definitely would have utilised it.The breakfast was fantastic and delicious, all very fresh.I have stayed in many hotels in Atlanta, most far more upmarket than the Wingate, but this was by far the best experience I have had. With the parking and wi-fi thrown in, the value for money is unbeatable.The staff make it amazing and they can not do enough to make sure that you have everything you need. Did not use the pool, but it was well maintained and very clean.I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone and I am a self confessed hotel snob. Don't hesitate about booking here and don't listen to the bad reviews. You will have a fantastic time here.\n",

      "  Review : When you have to think for a minute to come up with anything that wasn't great about a hotel stay, you picked a winner. In this case, the hotel is on a busy street, with no traffic light at the exit, so it's hard to get out of the driveway. Other than that, everything was outstanding. The room was gorgeous and clean, with beautiful hardwood floors. The staff was the perfect mix of Southern hospitality and modern efficiency. The location is great, in a super upscale part of Atlanta, with my favorite restaurant (Flip Burger Boutique) a 3 minute walk down the road. That more than made up for the fact that the hotel lacks a restaurant of its own.I'll be back, just for the hotel, even if I don't really have to be in Atlanta.\n",

I found the staff to be incredibley kind and the complimentry breakfast was fantastic. Eggs, sausage, bacon, bagels....even a chef to make you an omlett or waffles. The hotel is located in Buckhead which is a nicer area of atlanta...We got the Kingsize non smoking room....woodfloors seemed freshly redone. Overall this was a cozy room, that was safe and in a good area..... not to expensive and friendly staff\n",

      "  Review : The Hotel looks like nothing special. Inside it looks like a thousand others. But there is something about this that makes it an excellent place to stay. The rooms are large and the beds comfortable. But it is the people, like Marquis, that make every day \"A Powerful Day at the Wyndham\". Fabulous service. The complimentary limo, yes all 50 feet of it, is extremely useful for getting about and much cheaper than taking a cab. They took us to two restaurants and to the nearby Lennox Mall. It is conveniently located for a shopping splurge, which was our main purpose. Breakfast has too much choice! Too many good things to eat. Marquis gave us an excellent recommendation for a restaurant, so trust him to find you what you would like. Although it looks like nothing special I can see why it is rated so highly.\n",

I was so surprised by the service we received from the limo driver to the chef, everyone was great. And of course I met the hotel celebrity, Marquis, and he was just as pleasant and helpful as the comments indicated on trip advisor. I would definetly recommend this hotel and plan to stay again. The only negative is the hotel bar is a little too pricey and the pool is located outside of the hotel.\n",

Our room was clean and had hardwood flooring which was different. We tried to use the pool but it was a little too chilly and went into the hot-tub instead. The outdoor pool and hot tub area doesn't look as well maintained as the hotel. They provide complimentary limo service which was a treat for the kids and a surprise for my hubby. As other reviewers have mentioned, the breakfast was very nice and had plenty of hot and cold choices. Overall you can't beat this hotel with what's included for the price. Definitely would stay there again.\n",

      "  Review : From the moment I arrived and was greeted familiarly by Marquis, to the moment we checked out after a fabulous full breakfast hosted by Miss T, we felt like we were at home - only better! At home no one makes me to-order omelettes (free) or brews me fresh espresso by the cup (free). No one at home stocks a full bar (ok, not free but convenient!) for my after hours enjoyment, nor do they bring me fresh towels or have fresh cookies waiting for me in the afternoon (free). And no one ever chauffeurs me in a stretch Escalade to a fabulous dinner when I'm at home (yes, you guessed it - free)! The decor, including the bamboo floors in each room and oriental carpets in the hall, was similar to what I have seen in much more upgrade hotels costing $300+ per night. Wireless internet was included (request a low floor for good signal) as well as plenty of FREE PARKING (try finding that anywhere else in downtown Atlanta!). And the staff - they were impeccable! To a person, I felt like they cared about me and my family, and that they genuinely enjoyed working here. There is great shopping nearby (Nordstom Rack and H&M anyone?!), tons of fabulous restaurants and dozens of tony neighborhoods to explore. So, with a business hotel in the financial heart of Atlanta that has family-friendly weekend rates (~$119) and perks like these, why would I ever stay anywhere else again!\n",

      "  Review : As I found myself returning home to Canada from Afghanistan, I decided a 1 day lay-over for some R&R along the way would be great. A round of golf in the home state of The Masters seemed like a good spot for myself and my longtime co-worker and friend. After contacting the Wingate-Buckhead for some information about their hotel and golf packages I received a return e-mail asking how they could assist us in our travels. Before long we knew this would be a great place to stay...our room was booked with early check-in....golf was booked at the nearby Fulton-North...complimentary Limo was provided to and from the golf course as well as out for dinner and late night pick-up. The hotel couldn't do enough for us to make our stay as enjoyable as possible and I can't say enough good things about the staff. There was nothing to take away from this hotel experience and the price was certainly not out of line. Only wish I had more time to enjoy the city and surroundings, but there can always be a next time.\n",

We chose the hotel because our workshop was being held there, but I would go back for a personal stay. Marquis at the front desk remembered my name every time we spoke and offered us tips on dining and night life. The stretch limo took us where we wanted to go, and the full breakfast included in the room rate was excellent, with waffle and omelet stations and a cappuccino machine. We got a workshop-related deal - $115 a night, which included two very comfortable king beds in a spacious and pleasantly appointed room - but the rate first quoted to us by the toll-free number was just $159, so it is a good deal, even at regular rates. The only drawback was the entrance. If you are turning left, it is unclear that there is just the one entrance. The limo backs in and makes it look like the exit. We had to circle back to get in, but we learned after that.\n",

The staff is wonderful -- all the comments about Marquise are accurate -- he is such a welcoming presence. As well, Freny, the manager, and Chris, who was at the desk, were great. The limo driver ASKED if it was OK to take me to the airport, at the end of my stay, rather than just to the MARTA stop. The rooms are well appointed -- better than any hotels in this class or even in the next class above. I held two days of seminars in their meeting rooms, and everyone on the staff was so helpful there, too. The gentleman who cooked/served breakfast checked in on us frequently. My only caution: If you are not used to sleeping with your windows facing a busy street, request a room on the back side of the hotel. The rooms on the front side get traffic noise and light from street lamps.\n",

This guy wears lots of hats at this hotel. If only they could clone him!! We used the limo service and had a great time and didn't have to drive at all which was an added plus. The free breakfast was great as well. This hotel is in the perfect location for malls, shopping, and IKEA! The neighborhood is great. I know when we were planning our trip we wanted safety and a nice hotel and Wingate met every expectation we had!! We're planning on going back to Atlanta in March and will def be staying at the Wingate.\n",

The rooms were large immaculately clean and comfortable. I loved the business center it had everything you needed to keep your buisness running smooth.

      "  Review : We chose Atlanta as a central location for our colleagues to fly into from all over the country. We had 40 people in town for a 3 day meeting. I came across Wingate on TripAdvisor and when inquired, I was met with immeidate response, great prices and incredible \"perks\". We booked immediately.Location: Wingate is located in beautiful Buckhead and about 20 minutes from the airport. You are within walking distance or a short cab ride away from great bars, restaurants, gyms.The Hotel: This is THE perfect hotel for a meeting for a group of 40-50 people. Each hotel room was clean, charmingly decorated (LOVED the hardwood floors) rooms. The lobby is friendly and inviting and has a little cafe feel off the main lobby. There is also a small bar in the back that is perfect for a cocktail before heading out. The walls are a little thin and you can hear your neighbor at times but this was a minor flaw while there were so many other great attributes.The People: The staff, Marquis, Freny, etc were amazing and so personable. Marquis went above and beyond in every single aspect and did it with such friendliness and a charming smile. The Meeting Space/AV Equipment: They have 2 conference rooms that transformed to one. We fit 42 people classroom style perfectly. They have a build in projector. Very fair and affordable AV equipment and all worked flawlessly. We also made use of their polycom/telephone system to confernce in others that could not make the meeting live. Everything was perfect.They also have a very nice looking boardroom to hold about 8-10 people. We did not utilize it, but looked nice.SPECIAL PERKS: The Limos: They have two SUV Limosines that would take you anywhere within 3 miles of the hotel at no cost. This was an amazing and extremely cost efficient when trying to stay within a budget. The breakfast! The breakfast is included every morning in your overnight stay. This is not just your average continental breakfast of muffins and some fruit. We are talking omlettes, scrambled eggs, waffles, bacon, sausage, biscuits, gravy and all bread products, fruits, yogurts! Amazing, and again extremely cost efficient when trying to adhere to a budget.Business Center: Full 24 hour access to business center. You can print anything or go online for any amount of time. At NO cost.Wireless Internet: You can get it anywhere, at any time at any point in the hotel. At no cost. Fantastic.I highly recommend this hotel to business folks coming in for an overnight or a 2-3 day meeting. You can't beat the price, the hospitality or the extras that make this hotel a great choice for your next meeting.\n",

      "  Review : My wife and I checked into the hotel in the afternoon on Friday January 28th for two nights. We choose this hotel due to the reviews on trip advisor, price, and location. The front staff was very courteous and knowledgeable. We went to our room and were disappointed to find non-central A/C (one of my pet peeves of hotels) and our room had a connecting door with another room. The wood flooring in our room had what appeared to be water damage and there were gaps in the flooring. We took advantage of the limo service at night which was an excellent perk and one of the best features about the hotel. The breakfast is also great with homemade omelets, waffles, and a cappuccino machine. Unfortunately, the down fall of our stay came on Saturday afternoon when we had loud neighbors who first played loud Spanish music and then decided to have loud sex next door. Granted this is not the hotels fault, but since we had a room with a connecting door we could hear EVERYTHING. We asked to move rooms, which was granted to us. When we moved into the second room we noticed we could hear all the street traffic and the window in the room was broke. We had to move to the third room which was average like the first room.Overall, the hotel staff was very friendly and gracious about our experience at the hotel. The hotel has some significantly perks, but also some significant flaws. Ihad really high expectations that weren't met\n",

      "  Review : This guy is incredible! As the front desk guy, Marquis welcomed me at 5:00 the other day. Big smile, huge personality, great sense of humor. Came back from dinner, he was still there, with the same energy and enthusiasm from earlier. Then at 8AM, he is still behind the desk and to my amazement, greeted me with a Good Morning by my name. With all due respect to the Wingate, I expect this at the Ritz or Four Seasons, not here. This guy is a keeper. Oh yeah, this was my first time back since the room renovations and the rooms are very clean and comfortable. \n",

      "  Review : Whatever the Wingate is paying Marquis, it's not enough. I walked in after a long day of travel, tired and cranky, and his positive energy just transformed my mood. The man is Southern Hospitality Incarnate. Unlike the last traveller, I found the rest of the staff extremely charming as well. There's much to like about the Wingate and virutally nothing to dislike. The lobby isn't as smart as the rooms, which are elegant, contemporary and comfortable. I got a great night's sleep in the fabulous bed. The lobby does have the only automatic espresso machine I've ever encountered that makes truely delicious capuchino. If you're coming in by Metro from the arport, they send a stretch limo to pick you up from the Buckhead station. For free. I am not making this up. I stayed at the Wingate because it was extremely close to a buisness meeting, but I will definitely return there when I stay in Atlanta from now on. Marquis,\n",

Rooms were looking better than what was depicted in the pictures. We were in 5th floor. It was hard to find a critique for this hotel, the only thing is that they don't have fan in bathroom!\n",

      "  Review : Hi! Recently my husband and I stayed at this hotel for two nights. Normally, we try to stay in the higher class hotels in Atlanta (the Ritz Carlton Atlanta and the like), but after seeing that this hotel had been ranked #1 for quite a while we had to see why.Nevertheless we were very, very disappointed. Although the hotel does have a few employees who are very nice, there are a couple of them who could really care less about creating long-term relationships with the guests.As far as the room, my husband and I were very pleased because we chose a nice suite with a separate bedroom and large bath (which was separated from the glass encased shower – very nice indeed). The hotel does not offer room service, but the assortment of “dine-in” menus at the front desk was huge. Of course, you’re in Buckhead so finding food is not a problem. As mentioned in previous reviews, the complimentary breakfast is outstanding. An enormous variety of hot and cold foods, and the “made-to-order” omelets are definitely filling and tasty.The worst aspect of our stay was the noise level. Are the walls made of paper bags? Oh, my goodness – God forbid the wind blows. Every time somebody goes into their room, it sounds as if they are entering your room. In addition, unfortunately our suite was located near the pool, and the screams we had to endure were unbearable. My birthday weekend which was supposed to be an enjoyable weekend in was spent with me popping Tylenol. When I called down to the front desk to politely see if anything could be done about the noise, I was informed that “it was during pool hours, and the guests had the right to be noisy”. And here we were thinking that we had the right to enjoy our weekend getaway. The clerk really did not seem to care and didn’t even offer to relocate us to a different room. Yes, when the pool is open, you should swim and have a great time but it shouldn’t be to the point that you disturb others. In addition, at top notch hotels, when a guest makes a complaint, you handle it – you don’t make up excuses.Eventually my husband went downstairs to the front desk and said that we would be leaving if we didn’t get another room. Only then did we get another room, but in my opinion, my husband should not have had to go downstairs to get a change.Later on, we received a “formula” email excuse from management, but our celebration had been ruined by excessive noise and the ensuing migraine. My husband and I will not be staying at this hotel again, and if you want peace and quiet, you should consider going elsewhere.\n",

      "  Review : My overnight stay was in July of last year, however, I thought it was worth posting my experience with them. Their staff and the service they provided to me are some of the best I have encountered throughout my travels. I was in Atlanta to pick up an 8wk old puppy from a breeder in Acworth, Georgia. They drove me to Acworth and dropped me off at the breeders home. If wasn't the easiest place to find however, the driver was great, and got me there safe and sound. All the employees, from the front desk, to the limo driver, to the breakfast staff and of course the driver who took me to Acworth were all First Class. They have something at that hotel that works and its apparent from all the reviews. To the Wyndham executive, I hope the staff are recognized for their contributions and their consistency in providing exceptional service.\n",

They are in the process of installing HDTV service(much needed). But I have to say that we won't be going back because of one thing - noise. It wasn't partiers or unruly kids or street noise-it was the loud ventilating unit, the slamming of doors, the vacuuming of halls, the wakeup call in the next room that sounded like it was in ours, and finally the grunting coming from the bathroom next door that did us in. Are we alone in the feeling that even the nicest hotels don't pay enough attention to noise control?\n",

The evening started with incredible front desk service, a quick drink at the fully stocked bar and then a limo ride to Lenox mall for a steak dinner. The limo is available during the evening to take guests anywhere they need to go and truly made the night feel classy. We played golf at one of Buckhead's many golf courses and enjoyed the local nightlife scene. Andrew at the front desk took care of us and treated the group as family. The breakfast is wonderful and the cleanliness is unmatched\n",

      "  Review : I just stayed at this hotel over Thanksgiving. I was visiting family in Decatur who tried to convince me to stay closer at a different hotel, but I went with my instincts and stayed at this hotel based on the tripadvisor reviews. The hotel is very easy to get to and it has a great location. It 's not in the heart of downtown Atlanta, which is good because you can avoid a lot of traffic, but still be in downtown within minutes. The room was so clean and nicely decorated. I absolutely loved the hardwood floors in the room. I had no qualms about walking around barefoot. The beds were comfortable. There were no \"off\" smells in the room or hotel in general. Bathroom was big enough for one person to comfortably get around in. Towels were soft. Hotel staff was some of the most friendlist I have ever encountered. Every single one I ever passed by made a point to say \"hello\". Lastly, the full breakfast (included) was awesome. It has hot food and a chef waiting to mix you up an omelette or waffles. I will only stay at a this hotel on future trips to Atlanta.\n",

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel and would be more than happy to stay again. Too many good things to say but the best bits are the staff, full breakfast, all day coffee and fresh baked cookies every eve. nice sized rooms, nice bathroom products, super maid service and very clean, free parking, nice bar service, small but quiet pool and hot tub and all at a reasonable price. If I was being picky I would say that they could revise their bed making arrangement as they kind of layer the blankets with sheets that are too small for the beds and they always ride up in the night, but the beds are very comfy so no big deal.\n",

      "  Review : I stayed here for two nights in October 2010. There is very little wrong with this hotel. Its centrally located, its clean, aesthetically pleasing, and a great value. However, based upon all of these tripadvisor reviews we expected an amazing hotel experience. That was not to be. It looks like a 'nicer' Holiday Inn. The rooms were small with low ceilings. There was a constant loud industrial hum coming from a vent in the bathroom. This was not the type of vent attached to a on/off switch, and it was not an extractor. There was great confusion with housekeeping about when to clean our room (no english spoken, mis-relayed messages) and the complimentary full breakfast downstairs was a truly pedestrian/cafeteria like experience. We were given a street facing room that let in significant traffic noise.In its defense, the hotel did not claim to be something it wasn't. It was economical and centrally located. It was clean and my stay was adequate (Front desk staff was very nice and helpful, I should say). But tripadvisor's rating of #1 hotel in Atlanta made me think I was getting some great deal on an underpriced hotel. Not so my friend, not so.\n",

The rooms were also extremely nice for the price (hardwood floors, granite tops, etc). I couldn't have asked for anything more from my stay in Atlanta for the price I paid!

      "  Review : We selected this hotel for two reasons. First, it was #1 on Tripadvisor. Second, because they had very good rates on their website and gave us 20% off for staying a second night. I've read reviews that report the Staff was so friendly. This is one of the most friendly and courteous Staff that I have ever encountered. Having a limousine available for local transportation is a big plus for discovering Atlanta. The limo was prompt to pick us up.The room was very clean and comfortable. The decor was warm and welcoming.The included breakfast was great! The food was fresh and top shelf. Staff kept it well stocked and clean. They made omelets to order, had scrambled eggs, fresh breads, cold cereals and yogurts, espresso machine and fancy coffees and hot waffles.Don't have second thoughts about this hotel. It is what others have overwhelmingly reported.\n",

      "  Review : We were looking for a hotel in the Buckhead area, and chose this hotel based on the recommendations from trip advisor. Wow! We LOVED it! We had concert tickets to an event at Chastain Park, and called to see how close this hotel was to the concert. Our first impression was made by Alan, he was very friendly and helpful over the phone, and advised us that not only is the hotel very close, that we could have a free limo ride to and from the event. When we arrived, we were warmly greeted my Marquis and Monique, the super-friendly duo at the front desk. We felt like VIPs! The room was top notch, and we loved the wood floors. Craig the limo driver was great. Beautiful hotel! We met Alan in person when we headed out for a midnight snack. There are several great restaurants within a mile of the hotel. The staff absolutely makes this place a must stay. Thanks for making our concert weekend a very memorable one. We can't wait to come back, and we absolutely will choose this hotel again and again!\n",

      "  Review : The hotel is located in the heart of the posh Buckhead area of Atlanta and very close to the Lenox Square Mall and other local attractions. Unlike other hotels in the area, this hotel is reasonably priced. No compromises were made on quality though. Rooms are clean and nice, there is a pool, complimentary breakfast, complimentary internet, nice and friendly staff. I had an excellent stay and would definitely stay here again.\n",

      "  Review : Just left from my umpteenth stay at the Wingate on Piedmont, conveniently located between Roswell's lively section and on Piedmont near Lenox, Phipps and Peachtree in the heart of Buckhead. Yes there are more imposing hotels all around who sometimes offer rooms at the Wingate price point, but what a relief when fighting Atlanta urban traffic to not have to get a valet to get your car. Yes, a real free parking lot and easy in and out anytime of day. Location is excellent. The Wingate is not the Ritz, but this is why you want to stay there...they are so determined to keep the property up and to serve every client with courtesy and you are not nickled and dimed or treated like you are an imposition. Starting with the decent business/computer center and the Much More Than You Deserve for the price you paid Breakfast (actual made to order omelets and waffles), pleasant service and wait staff..all free with your rent...and on to the bar service that is unexpected...hats off to bartender/engineer \"E\". Marquis is ever ready to respond to any requests for directions, advice, limo service, extra items in your room, Monique is mailing me the phone charger I left behind :), the midnight shift managers (Al for instance) are also long term hires who are just as courteous as the day desk staff. You don't feel that the employees are floating through. Staff members appear to function as a team.The Wingate offers a great place to NOT get treated like a tourist in Atlanta....and is a great place to stay for business or leisure trips..a real \"stress reducer\" hotel.\n",

      "  Review : This hotel was rated very high and it totally lived up to the rating. First, the location is great for traveling anywhere in the Atlanta area. It's very close to attractions such as the aquarium and Turner Field (baseball). The drive to Six Flags, White Water, and Stone Mountain are all about 30 minutes away. Secondly (but most important to our family),the room was extremely clean and comfortable! Third, the FREE buffet breakfast every morning is fresh and delicious. The chef prepares omelets and waffles by request. The staff is very personable and helpful. There is a 24 hour exercise room and computer lab. We found the computer lab helpful when researching places to go and eat. We will definitely stay here again when we visit Atlanta!!!\n",

      "  Review : The hotel is located near Lennox mall and several good restaurant. When I first arrived at the hotel at 3:15pm the rooms were not ready. I waited about 30 mins at the lobby. The front office clerk was professional. The room was cleaned. I love the hard wood floors in a hotel room. The bed was a little hard but pillows comfortable. The evening clerk was not so kind. The next day we used the stretch limo to go shopping and it picked us up later in the afternoon. At night, we went to Sambuca (jazz restaurant), with the limo again. We felt like living as celebrities.\n",

      "  Review : My friend and I stayed at the Wingate for three nights and the whole experience was amazing from beginning to end. When we checked in, we were greeted by Marquis who absolutely delighted us with his infectious enthusiasm and energy. He was most helpful during our stay....he suggested many wonderful choices for dining and shopping; looked up numbers for us in the phone book; gave us a map of the MARTA system and highlighted our route; even gave me a band-aid for a minor injury; and he always smiled and spoke to us every time we exited and entered the hotel!!! Marquis went way above and beyond the call of duty to ensure our stay was a happy one. The limo service was wonderful for our destinations within three miles of the hotel....kudos to Ben and Craig for treating us like queens! The full breakfast each morning was totally awesome...grits, eggs, bacon, sausage, and waffles and omelets cooked to perfection! And to top it all off, the rates were reasonable and our room was fabulous....clean, very comfortable beds, massaging shower head, no carpet, and quiet! What more could anyone want? The Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta - Buckhead will definitely be my hotel of choice anytime I am in the Atlanta area and I will definitely recommend it to all my friends!!!!\n",

      "  Review : I recently stayed at this hotel while traveling to Atlanta for several days.The hotel staff is pleasant, the rooms are spacious, cleanly decorated, and for the Buckhead area of Atlanta a reasonable price.Those are the positives.When we checked into the hotel we were in room 405. The floor was buckled and bounced up and down like a bounce house at a fun park. This was something I could live with but the air-conditioning would get hotter and hotter the longer it was on. That afternoon we were heading out to a braves game and told the front desk about the problem. The game lasted until well after 12am (2 ½ hour rain delay and extra innings) exhausted and tired with the Air still broken.The next day went down told them about the air again so they moved us to another room this time 522. Beds in both rooms were the same just adequate nothing more. This is when I found out something else interesting about this hotel. Odd numbered rooms are on the back side of the hotel even numbers are on the front and face the road.Road noise is horrendous in these rooms on the front. To top it off the doors have almost a 2 inch gap under them and you can plainly hear the conversations of people walking up and down the halls any time of day or night.So to recap. The good points are price, staff, clean rooms, good hot breakfast, free transport within 3 miles of hotel, free parking, real glass glasses in the rooms.The bad points noisy rooms, small pool, small dirty luke warm hot tub, only mediocre beds.If you decide to stay here pick a room that is an odd number, away from the elevators because you can hear everything going on in the halls.This is not a bad hotel but I do not think I will be returning.\n",

The rooms were clean and smelled fresh! I travelled with five children, my hubby and my mother in law. This isn’t a large family type of hotel (unless your children are older and can stay in rooms by themselves) but I wanted to try something different and it worked fine. I thoroughly enjoyed the complimentary hot breakfast bar. I hadn’t had an omelet in a while and the chef made it just fine along with some tasty mini waffles! My children really enjoyed the limo shuttle service to and from dinner. I am glad we took the opportunity to visit this Wingate. Kei (www.embracethenow.net)\n",

      "  Review : My husband and I planned to stay at this hotel to attend a wedding. Unfortunately, my husband became ill on the way to the airport, and we went to the hospital instead. We thought we might be able to catch a flight later, but my husband was admitted. I was in touch with the staff at the front desk at the Wingate, and they were most helpful and compassionate about the situation. The associate graciously delayed our arrival for one day. We eventually canceled the entire reservation, and expected a request for the full payment. You can imagine our relief and surprise when told everything was fine, and no payment would be required under the circumstances. I was not even requested to forward any documentation. I, therefore, rate this hotel excellent for its policy about a cancellation for medical reasons, for its front desk staff and the hotel's limo driver. We hope to visit Atlanta in the future, and will definitely choose the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta-Buckhead!Thanks a million, WingateGlenn and JoyceCoatesville, PA\n",

      "  Review : I love this hotel. The location is really good inbetween Atlanta's 2nd city Buckhead and the kind of hip night life in and around Roswell. You can walk to both if you have too, but you shouldn't have to because The Wingate provides a free limo service within 3miles (but they often skirt just a little further if they need too, regardless there is SO much within 3 miles in the way of restaraunts, shopping, night life, and very pleasant parks you won't need too. I can't say enough about the staff, I have stayed here mulitple times on holiday weekends over the course of 2 years and they never fail to amaze me. I have walked through the doors downtrodden and tired and the bright smiles, and how can I make your stay better attitude always do the trick. There is a bar downstairs and a hot tub and pool as well, which is pretty standard for your \"Insert-name Inn\" and \"insert-name Suites\" but I have never felt like it was just another stay at one of the hundred or so different cities or hotels I've stayed at from Manhattan to Oklahoma City to Enterprise Alabama. Any question I've asked from where to get a hair cut to where to get some quality wine and cheese to impress a French girlfriend they have gone out of their way to find the answer for me. Plus that wine and cheese was extra tasty in the hot tub ;-)Great location and great staff, that about sums it up.\n",

      "  Review : After having read the reviews that specifically mention Monique and Marquis as giving fantastic customer service, I couldn't agree more! I spoke with Monique to make my reservations just hours before my arrival in Atlanta. She took care of everything and when I arrived and was greeted by Marquis, I knew I'd made an excellent choice. Free parking is somewhat of a rarity with Atlanta properties so I always look for hotels with this amenity! While the parking is not covered, the area seems perfectly safe and I wasn't worried about leaving my car there overnight. I noticed a large group of people who were waiting in the lobby. They were being driven to nearby Chastain Park in one of the hotels complimentary stretch Navigator limos. I was only in town for one night on business, but it seemed like a great option to Atlanta traffic! The only downside to the hotel would have to be the beds. The mattress was a bit firm for my taste so I didn't sleep all that well, but overall it was a very nice stay!\n",

The free breakfast was good. The room was very clean and the King Size bed was comfortable.

We are considering coming back in August with the kids to see another game and will not look at another place. The staff was friendly and this is a well managed hotel. The costs for both nights was under $190.00 tax inclusive which compared to the price of some of the four star hotels after you pay for parking covered the cost our two most expensive meals.\n",

      "  Review : The staff (reception, breakfast service, dining, etc.) is very friendly, welcoming and helpful. The morning \"rush\" for the breakfast was handled well through the hard work by the breakfast staff, and my wife and I were very satisfied with the offerings. Transport in the area was provided, the drivers friendly, and their skill in driving the limos in tight spaces impressive. Pool was nice, accomodations clean and modern, and the overall experience was great. Highlight, however, has to be the staff. Absolutely outstanding in their welcoming approach. Southern hospitality at its finest.\n",

      "  Review : My husband and I were in ATL for a wedding and our daughter, her husband, and two year old daughter came from Idaho. We requested joining rooms and got them (it doesn't always work). The location was perfect to shopping and our Buckhead wedding location. Our room provided a small refrigerator which was very important for our granddaughters food and milk. A nice pool, hot tub and Limo service--free!! The staff was very nice and helpful. The FREE breakfast was above and beyond-omelets, fruit, oatmeal, waffles--you get the picture. Needless to add we highly recommend anyone to stay there, and enjoy!\n",

      "  Review : This was my second visit to this hotel. All was well, until we checked out and returned home. My spouse left his medicine bag in the room! No problem, I thought. I'll call and we'll get back on the road for a 5 hour trip to get it. The Night Manager basically said we called too late and that we could check back the next day at 8 am for Lost & Found. Even after I explained to him the medical condition and the urgent need for the meds, he didn't care. I asked if he could call the General Manager or Head of Housekeeping or anyone who could access Lost & Found. He said no. I asked if he could he at least check the log to see if the bag was turned in by the housekeeper. He said no such log existed. Wow...not the 'service' I expected. We called the next morning at 8 am only to be told that Lost & Found wouldn't open until 9 am. All these technicalities from hotel staff over medicines that are life saving. Granted, we left the bag in the room. I get that's our fault and that the hotel is not responsible. I guess I just thought I'd find a decent person who gave a darn and cared to go beyond the call of duty to help us. Boy was I wrong. Very disappointed. We were supposed to stay at the W Hotel but switched to stay here. I regret that decision.\n",

The morning breakfast was wonderful, and the man overseeing breakfast was sure to get us a high chair each morning. We enjoyed the pool and the complimentary limo service.

      "  Review : Good stay until the last 2 days.On the fourth day of our stay, we returned to the room for a much needed nap and it hadn't been cleaned. I called the desk but it was the very end of the cleaning shift. The desk clerk asked if there was a do not disturb sign on the door. I said no, emphatically. I filled out a form in the room explaining the situation, and received an e-mail from someone (???manager) saying that we had left a do not disturb sign on the door- he was adamant.I have been a part of discussions by friends (who travel often) and they say that this is beginning to happen more and more- always on the last day, always for the claim of the do not disturb sign. This is happening at a variety of hotel chains, not just one.Something is going on and I hope that the hotels address it. And, by the way, so much for the 100% satisfaction guarantee.\n",

      "  Review : My husband and I went over on a Friday night and arrived about 10pm. Chris, the desk clerk, was very pleasant and helpful. He was even helping two people in front of him and one on the phone. We went up to our room, the halls were a bit stuffy, but not unpleasant. The room was warm when we arrived because they conserve electricity, but upon adjusting the temp it cooled off quickly and was very pleasant. The beds were very comfortable and my 5 year old was amused by being able to see the cars going by on the street below. We awoke Saturday morning and went down for breakfast expecting to only find the usual muffins and cold cereal, but to our surprise found a very nice hot breakfast available. They would even make you an omelet if you wanted. Overall it was an excellent experience.\n",

      "  Review : I have to say that I have stayed in some of the nicest hotels on my travels and I travel a lot. This hotel showed us that quality comes in any size and simple things like manners and general care of the customers and helpfullness can be first class.From the front desk staff Marcus, Monique, all the night staff to the bar man who I call the Doctor due t his knowledge of drink, to the drivers right through to the cleaning staff were so helpful they went out of their way where nothing was too much to ask. This was one of my best experiences I had at a hotel and this is a credit to the Manager Anthony for this level of service of him and his staff. If you notice I am using names because this is how personal the service was. The Wingate by Wyndham is the first choice for me just from this experience I do not have a complaint about this place at all. This hotel was recommended to me and I would never have thought it would have made a impact on my holiday as it has right now. Top Mark to you!Kevin Stuart from London\n",

      "  Review : I first was very impressed with Marquis when I checked in so cheerful and helpful. Later that evening I got into my car to pick my daughter up from the airport giving myself 1/2 hour to get there. My battery was dead. I was very upset worrying about my daughter. Marquis came to the rescue and not only settled my nerves but called the shuttle driver who was returning from a shuttle drop and he (Craig) brought cables. Craig had Etienne (another employee) help him as they had to push my car out to jump it. All this was done in time for me to get my daughter right on time. All three of them should be highly commended for their thoughtfulness and professionalism they provided me. Their care made me feel very secure during my stay. And for the hotel everything about it was above and beyond too! I would not hesitate to stay their again or recommend it. Thank you again for such special care. Nancy L.\n",

I have worked with Anthony, the director of guest services, throughout the planning and this has been a very pleasant experience. The Wyyndham of Buckhead has met all of my needs plus more. The rooms are lovely and they have so many other facilities to offer. The complimentary transportation, and the is fabulous having so many out of town guests. Anthony, and the front desk, have been so helpful in planning this special occasion for us. I would recommend the Wyndham in Buckhead to anyone that is planning a trip to Atlanta or just a special evening. Thank you to the Wyndham for all your assistance and being there for us.

      "  Review : Our stay at the Wingate in Buckhead was one of the Best Experiences in traveling I have ever experienced.....from the moment we drove up until we left for home....still thinking of that adorable Marquis and the rest of the staff that we had the pleasure of encountering. The staff was so much more than just the staff...they are the smile and warm welcome you come home to after a busy day of shopping and enjoying the hustle and bustle of Atlanta......It was like a movie.....you wanted to move there and be a permanment guest.....It is rare that you find a public place where the guest is the most important thing about the hotel or inn. The Wingate was spotless ,beautiful , comfortable and full of charm. I would ask the hospitality industry to ask themselves this question..When there are so many mobile people today and so many people with the heart and talent to make their accomodations a Jewel why do they continue to follow the rules of halfway is just fine...halfway clean ,halfway pleasant,halfay warm and welcoming or they just do not care... the Hospitality Industry has become one giant dirty Industry.........THANK HEAVEN there is a Wingate Buckhead by Wyndham !!!!!!!!! Go,PULL Up,Walk-in, and see what I mean.....Hugs and Lots of love to the staff at the Wingate,Buckhead.....See you soon!!!!!!! The Caseys\n",

      "  Review : We returned to visit son in Buckhead on a weekend when many luxury properties at Lenox Square offered bargain rates, but decided to return to the Best Little Hotel in Buckhead instead. Why? No valet parking, no parking fees, a calm location in the heart of the intensity that is Buckhead without the stress. The Staff at this Wingate (Hello, Marquis, we are talking about you!..along with your fellow managers who are the same people I have seen over two years of visits) set a high mark on welcome and class and all deserve raises. I can't think of a Wingate that actually pulls clients away from 5 star hotels but this staff pulls it off! Breakfast is just a cut above re attractive, clean and gracious and is included, lobby and rooms are pleasant and requests from guests are honored with a smile. I do use the computers near the office. Shuttle service is also offered graciously if you want to be dropped off at a Marta station or a restaurant.This hotel staff should be training others.\n",

      "  Review : I stay at this hotel quite often as it’s a very convenient hotel for me when I travel to Atlanta for business. Located in the heart of Buckhead, it’s centrally located and they have a nice shuttle service that travels within a few miles (for no cost). LOVE the guest rooms because they all have hardwood floors! No nasty hotel carpeting, so you can go barefoot!! The parking is free (which is a rarity in this area) and the rooms are inexpensive (relative to comparable hotels). Not only do they offer a nice breakfast (with hot items), they also added a cocktail hour where they have some snack foods.All in all, for the money and location, I whole heartedly recommend this hotel. They are wonderful to returning guests too (I always get a nice welcome package in my room).\n",

      "  Review : Where do I begin? The lobby is gorgeous and makes a great first impression. Marquis checked us in and could not have been more friendly and personable. Also, ahead of our stay, I emailed Anthony a few times and he also was very friendly and accommodating.This hotel is kind of in a residential/office space area, with trees and sidewalks. Very cozy feel to it and it was nice not to be in an area where there were a ton of hotels. The room was open and airy and very nicely decorated. We had a suite with the separate bedroom, sofa bed and we also requested a roll away bed and there was plenty of room for our family of four. The bathroom is very luxurious and had a HUGE jacuzzi tub with separate shower. The room also had a small kitchen area, table with 4 chairs, desk, sofa, chair and 2 tv's. The tv's are old school, but were just fine. The room was quiet and comfortable.Breakfast was fine and there were plenty of options, including omelets, Belgian waffles and Biscuits and gravy. Throughout the day, there was always coffee, tea and lemon or lime ice water on hand. In the afternoon, there are cookies. Some days there is even free food and appetizers in the evening. There is also a bar that opens at 5pm.The pool was very nice, it is outdoors though, so make sure to keep that in mind for the winter months. The elevators were quick and surprisingly very pretty with the same tile floor in them as the lobby area. You will receive a complimentary USA Today newspaper at your door every AM.There were a few limos at the hotel that would take you within a 3 mile radius. Very nice touch, even though we never used them. The service and southern hospitality was outstanding. I would definitely stay here again (and again!) Thank you for an amazing stay, Buckhead Wingate!\n",

      "  Review : I chose this place because other TripAdvisor reviewers were so complimentary of it. They were right. This hotel is well-run by friendly staff, has nice rooms and is reasonably priced.The managers were very welcoming and attentive, and seemed concerned that each traveler was satisfied with his or her experience there. The rooms had wood floors with attractive rugs, and they were very clean. Microwave and fridge also provided. The full breakfast bar featuring omelets and waffles was good, not great. Many of Atlanta's better restaurants are nearby, and the hotel has a limo that will take you to them if they are within three miles.The only complaints I can think of have to do with the windows in the rooms. The pull-down shades allow a lot of light into the room during the day beause their edges aren't sealed off. The windows also let street noise in if you are on the side of the hotel near Piedmont. This is not an issue, with us, but I know it can be troublesome for some travelers.I strongly recommend this hotel\n",

      "  Review : Marquis delivered awesome customer service at the main desk. He was always so positive, so personable, and so accommodating. This man deserves an employee if the year award the way he works that hotel desk. He goes above and beyond and he quickly learns your name and calls all of his guests by name every time they are in and out of the lobby to personalize your stay . I enjoyed the hotel's atmosphere immensely. They exemplified southern hospitality. The food during happy hour, though I didn't try much, was inviting. The hot breakfast offered a great variety and was tasty, far better than some comparable hotels. The service did not stop at the main desk by any means. The rooms featured warm colors, a wood laminate floor, with king beds, a full couch and sitting area, the usual desk, fridge, and microwave. They were nice, but the stand outs of this stay were by far the employees! Oh let's not forget the limo service (a stretch Lincoln Navigator limo) was a perfect touch for our late afternoon shopping trips and dinners out each evening after working each day. It's no wonder this hotel is rated so highly. I would recommend it to anyone, and would love to come back sometime for pleasure, instead of just for business. Hats off to Marquis and all the employees associated with the Atlanta Wingate at Buckhead! Darlene\n",

      "  Review : WOW!!!!..This was, by far, the most amazing hotel stay we have had in quite a few years. The moment we walked in and was warmly greated by Chris we knew the reviews we had read on Tripadvisor were absolutely accurate. All the staff have the same goal of providing exceptional care for all the guests. They have been well trained in hospitality, but it comes across more than just a job. It comes across as being more of who they are as individual people who simply love to treat people the way they want to be treated. EXCEPTIONAL.ROOM: I surprised my wife with a King Bed Suite. She entered the room before I did and thought the hotel had made a mistake \"Is this our room?' She was totally surprised. The two separate rooms, hardwood floors, wetbar, cordless phone, jacuzzi tub and very comfortable bed was well worth the extra cost. (Which was still way less than we would have paid for a standard room elsewhere.)LOCATION/AMENITIES: We wanted to see the Aquarium 8.7 miles from the hotel and Martin Luther King Museum 6.7 miles from the hotel, so we were happy about how close the hotel was to those sites. We didn't use the pool, gym or business center, but we saw other guests that did. They were all close by and readily available. There was no maze of hallways to navigate to get to any of them that you typically see in other hotel layouts. Now the FREEBIES are just one of many amenities that really gets everyone excited about Wingate at Buckhead. The hotel provides for free what they could easily charge for. They don't just do it free, they go top quality for free. The free breakfast is well laid out and there is plenty to go around. The cook to order omelette bar and waffles are a welcomed extra not normally provided for free. The parking around the hotel is free as well.Ok.. Now for what I liked the best. The hotel provides a free shuttle service. I laugh at their use of the word \"shuttle\". Because you think of a passenger van or some other means of private shuttle transportation. But take a look at my photo of their \"shuttle\". That's right it is a stretch SUV Limo. There is a 3 mile radius to the hotel where you can use the limo or Escalade for free. My wife and I used the limo to go to SAMBUCO for dinner and jazz. (Great place). We stayed past the 11pm limo cutoff and the restaurant called a cab for us. The next night we did the dinner and movie thing. I called the front desk and they suggested AMC Fork and Screen. Great suggestion. We took the limo and then the limo came back when we were ready to go HOME.:)I plan on going back in three months for absolutely no reason other than to enjoy my new vacation home away from home. It will be nice to visit \"family\" again.My wifes family has been planning a family reunion to be held in Atlanta in July 2010. I am suggesting to my wife that they change the location to the Wingate at Buckhead.Thanks again to all the front desk staff, food service staff, housekeeping staff and transportation staff. And a special thank you to Anthony Hines-Tecoy. I love your title..\"Director of First Impressions\". Not only have you and your team made a great first impression, but Wingate has made a very positive lasting impression.See you soon.Willie F.\n",

We had a combination of double rooms and suites. The rooms were spacious, clean, nicely decorated, and very comfortable. I especially enjoyed the wood flooring and wet bar in the suites.

      "  Review : My wife joined me for a couple days in between two business meetings in New Orleans. Her stay there was in a one bedroom suite at the newly renovated Roosevelt Hotel. I was a bit concerned that, in spite of the top rating for the Wingate, she might feel a \"let down\" from having stayed at the very fine Roosevelt. On the contrary, she was very happy with all aspects of our stay. We both wondered why there were limos parked at the Wingate (Anthony says it's because they also own the transportation company). Chris checked us into a nice room on an upper floor, told us all of what we might need to enjoy our stay, gave us a list of restaurants (all of which were in the three mile free transportation radius) and recommended a couple he thought we'd enjoy. We heeded his advice and had a very fine meal at the Buckhead Diner (MUCH more than a diner). There was a complimentary breakfast (which included made to order omelets and waffles), a good running computer (two, actually) from which I was able to check email and print a boarding pass, a fitness center (didn't use it), a pool (didn't use it either), and the most friendly and helpful staff I've encountered in quite a while. All in an excellent location close to dozens of restaurants and shopping areas. Without a doubt, I'll stay at the Wingate any time I am in Atlanta.\n",

      "  Review : Throughout my career, I have stayed at a variety of hotels at a variety of prices. No hotel then or now could possibly compare with the quality of service we received at the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta - Buckhead. The staff (particularly Marquis, Craig and the chefs) have perfected the lost art of customer service. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in the Atlanta area. I will definitely return. Keep up the excellent work!Melissa- Detroit, MI\n",

      "  Review : Overall, I am very pleased with my 2-night stay here. We were given a non-smoking room, which was awesome! The shower head was really luxurious. I was impressed with the water pressure. I also really enjoyed the nice-smelling soaps. The service was outstanding. My sister arranged to have champagne and chocolate delivered to our room as a surprise for my birthday, and I am very happy that the staff obliged. The heating unit on the wall was very efficient and heated the room in minutes. The little mini-mart in the lobby is excellently stocked with snacks and other small things one might need on a trip. I love the free parking, free internet and the free breakfast. Even though our room faced the main road the sound was minimal.A couple of things I thought could be improved at this hotel. 1-the beds are a bit dated. I appreciate the number of linens and blankets provided because I tend to get cold at night but they were not of high quality. I wish the bed was a little bit more comfortable. I could almost feel springs. 2-please improve the soundproofing between connected rooms. We had a group of 3 horribly loud women next door who would come into their room at about 2am each night (and all other times) screaming and laughing. Despite these two small issues, I felt that we chose a good hotel for our short visit to Atlanta.\n",

      "  Review : I have stayed at Wingate at Buckhead in Atlanta every year for the past several years when we meet for our annual business meeting. The service we receive has ALWAYS been unsurpassed. Our group host/concierge ALWAYS works diligently to ensure that all our council members are well cared for, that all our needs are met, and that we are shuttled wherever we need to go in the area. Drivers are constantly attentive to our needs as well.We receive first class treatment by a first class staff in a first class hotel. To be frank, I have never been as well treated in any other hotel, even those which have been far more costly.The pool, workout room and breakfast areas are great selling points. For those who like a nighcap, a cozy bar area awaits your presence. Business travelers who happen to have forgotten their laptops will appreciate the well equipped business center.Rooms are not only clean and spacious, but perfectly outfitted for either relaxation or for working after hours. Every time I have visited, hallways have been quiet, and rooms are well sound proofed. Beds are very comfortable. Room amenities include a nice TV, a small fridge, microwave and coffee maker. Bathrooms, though not large, are well equipped, clean and well maintained. I feel both well cared for and perfectly safe in this hotel.Business travelers to Buckhead and nearby areas will find the location to be perfect. The hotel is very close to business areas, but a block or two away from the bustle of the highrise jungle. It suits our purposes perfectly. As well, if you're in for historical sight seeing and the like, this location is only a short distance from some of the most gorgeous historical parts of Atlanta, with easy, nearby access to both interstates and major inner city thoroughfares.The thing I like best about this hotel is its personable staff. Our concierge and front desk staff always greet me by name and remember me from stay to stay. I feel like I'm coming home to Atlanta when I stay in this hotel. At my last stay, our group host was off work when I arrived, but phoned my room to welcome me to the hotel. Isn't THAT an unusual kindness?The thing I like least about this hotel is that I'm always on the run for business meetings and hardly have time to enjoy the benefits offered.So, whether your need is business or pleasure, this hotel is restful, classy, friendly and worth every penny.\n",

      "  Review : When I called to the Wingate by Wyndham Buckhead, I had no idea what I was about to encounter. Because my request was for more rooms than the lady at the Front Desk could quote me a rate for, I was transferred to the Sales Agent. Little did I know that I was about to get the treatment of my life. You don't have to listen too carefully to his message for it clearly stated that if he did not callback within 10 minutes, he could be reached on his cellphone. And he actually gave his cellphone number! I called the number and I heard beautiful music. At first, I thought this could have been a mistake, but I let it continue. I'm glad I did. \"This is Anthony,\" is how he answered. I gave him my name and asked him how he was doing. \"I'm wonderfully outstanding, thank you. How are you doing?\" I was taken aback because no salesperson has ever made me feel as if they truly cared about how I was feeling. I gave Anthony my specifics and he said that he was out of the office at the time but that he would check on my request and give me a call back in about 20 minutes. I accepted his response. I truly did not feel that I was going to get a response. My phone rang within the 20 minutes and I was given a quote for the rooms. I felt the quote was a little high and asked if there was anything else that could be done. After Anthony gave me the hotel's complimentary amenities (all of which I could have read myself), I felt that he quoted me a very comfortable rate for the Buckhead area. This salesman advised me of everything and reminded me that I had his cell number if I had any questions. As we ended the call, I realized I didn't have his full name. He told me it was Anthony Hines-Tecoy. I'm only spelling it correctly because it was on the contract he sent me. Now, I feel \"Wonderfully Outstanding\" because my group and I will be staying at the Wingate Buckhead. From the start, I have been impressed with Wingate Buckhead.\n",

      "  Review : This was your average family-oriented hotel. Nothing extraordinary here--the limo is a nice touch, but we never used it. The linens were mediocre; even my kids said they were \"scratchy.\" With a Ritz and a J W Marriott in town, (where we stayed the last time), I can't imagine how this hotel is rated #1 in all of Atlanta. I have nothing negative, except for when at breakfast you can find some of Atlanta's finest visitors in their pajamas and house shoes, complete with a rag on their head. Why must people go out in public this way? Also, at this breakfast, it was a little unnerving for my children and me to see a sweet-looking hispanic woman working the omelet station only to be rudely reprimanded in front of everyone that she had been told to perform a different task. When the lady replied that there were guests who wanted omelets, and no one else was available to prepare them, the rude manager-lady quickly yelled something like, \"I told you to stay over there!\" (seeming to mean somewhere other than the omelet station). Nothing in worse than seeing an employee being treated that way in front of paying customers. We won't be back.\n",

I had a grand suite and it was as big as my bedroom at home , so right away I knew I would not miss my bedroom or my bed. The room was beautiful and enchanting with the canopy on the 4 poster bed. I could have stayed in the room my entire stay an would have been happy and well rested. I plan to stay at Wingate again and also recommend it to my family and friends.\n",

      "  Review : During my travels and holding various conferences through out the various states, I have certain standards and expectations for my events. The meeting room must be easily accessible, quiet and be close to restrooms and restaurants. They hotel must also have an experienced staff who can handle my requests and provide what may be needed for my program. We are also looking for accommodations for our participants that will give them rest, safe environment, and easy mode of transportation in the surrounding areas. The Wingate in Buckhead goes beyond my wildest expectations by meeting and surpassing all of my needs. They have eco-friendly rooms, taking into consideration people who may have allergies, thus hard wood floors. They provide an excellent breakfast in the morning.... and I mean fresh omelets, bacon, eggs, fruit, .. you name it they have it hot and ready for you. In the evening they open their full service bar and also provide finger foods for their guests as well. They have the ability to provide you and your group with catered lunches or dinners if you choose. How does this all go off every time without a hitch? The experience I have at this hotel it is due to the wonderful Management of the owners, Freny and Burgess Jokhi. They have made this a wonderful working environment and they strive daily for excellence. As a result they have a staff of like-minded people. And can I tell you it is people who have been with them forever. Yes, I see the same faces, all the time. They choose their staff wisely and they all become family. Coming here to me is like seeing my family. Monique at the front desk, warm smiles and yes I can do that for you. Marquis, I just want to call the hotel to jump-start my energy level every day. He is full of excitement and gives you the warmest feel good on the phone. Anthony, the sales manager, he is willing and able to meet all of the needs I have for our meetings and supports those who may need extra help in securing a room or something they may need in the room. Mrs. T, Deborah and Heriberto, make the ease of setting up for my program effortless. She supplies whatever the participants needs to be comfortable, she works with me and any last minute changes, at times she reads my mind and is there with what I want before I ask. Etienne, well he is the rock and the lifesaver of every technical issue I may have. He is there with a smile and can I tell you he makes a great drink also. Ben and Craig can take you safely around town in the limo service they provide and stand ready to serve you... even take you to the airport. Great cars, excellent drivers, part of the family.So this is my home away from home. The Wingate has become the milestone that I grade all others. On a scale of 1 star to 5 stars.... I give them a 10 star for meeting and going beyond my Wildest Expectations....... Every time, without fail.\n",

      "  Review : Our daughter was getting married and we needed a hotel close to the venue to recommend all of our out of town guests that needed a place to stay. We looked at several hotels close to the venue and decided on the Wingate. We tried to select a hotel that would reflect style and grace, yet at an affordable price. The Wingate was THE place. First, the staff at the Wingate is exceptional. When you call the hotel, or visit the front desk of the hotel, you are greeted with a most upbeat, professional and courteous person. Monique and Marquis, you know who you are! The staff is awesome! I've been living in Atlanta since 1979 and have come to understand that great customer service is a thing of the past. Not so at the Wingate. It all goes accordingly due to the attention of manager Anthony Hines-Ticoy. He is the BEST!! When we first met Anthony, we noticed his charming personality. He assured us that each and every one of our guests would be pampered and we were NOT disappointed. The rooms are quite nice, very luxurious, clean and comfortable. At night, the bar (which is attended by Etienne, the South African) is quite lively. At morning, it is transformed into a breakfast room which serves Hot Breakfast. Theres a fitness room available to all guests, internet is also provided at no additional charge. Theres a pool and hot tub, going even in the coldest weather. The real topper, is that there is limo service (a very nice STRETCH limo) that will take you anywhere you want to go within 3 miles. That covers most of all the shops and nice restaurants in the Buckhead area, and oh did I mention, that is also complimentary!!!! My husband and I have traveled the world and stayed at many of the top rated hotels, such as Mandarins, Peninsulas, and the ever famous Beverly Hills Hotel, etc. For the money, check out the Wingate, you will NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!\n",

      "  Review : Anthony and his staff provide the highest level of service to the business traveler like myself. The front desk team is always warm and welcoming, remembering my name when I arrive even after months of my last stay. The rooms are always clean and perfect and the lobby lounge and bar always warm and welcoming with E. as the host and recently introduced happy hour snacks. Chris, Marquis and Monique at the front desk are always pleasant and efficient when necessary. The complimentary travel service in the very nice cars is a BIG plus for when when needing a ride from Marta or to a restuarant for business dinner. Greg, Ben and the others are always kind and available to meet my needs. I would highly recommend the Wingate in Buckhead to any fellow business traveler who is looking for great accommendations and service in the area.Regards, Kim Hamilton\n",

      "  Review : I can't say enough about the incredible service you get from the employees at the Wingate in Buckhead. For a very reasonable price, you get people who remember your name, offer to drive you around the area in a limo, offer to make reservations for you, attend to all of your requests with a smile, and who seem genuinely happy to be helping their guests. The rooms are homey, with hardwood floors and oriental rugs. The breakfast was top notch for an included breakfast. I'd stay here anytime I went to ATL - you can't beat it for the price.\n",

      "  Review : Hi-I am so very happy with my experience at Wingate at Windham. Every morning, my kids and I would wake to a very pleasant, warm greeting from front desk staff: Marquis- he had a very excellent warm & caring greeting & Management & staff. This included the kitchen staff Supervisor, who was very kind and her employees: Humberto and Bertha who are two amazing people. They were very attentive to my specific food choices and accomodated my request. The minute Bertha saw me walk toward Humberto, who was preparing the omelettes, she made sure she told him exactly how I liked my omelette. In addition, Humberto & Bertha spoke to me and took the time to listen to my concerns about specific questions regarding Atlanta living. In addition, everyone were very attentive to my kids and they were very happy with the family like atmosphere. Lastly,the driver, Craig treated us like family and gave us the most outstanding warm and friendly and courteous service and he was very attentive to my kids.I really appreciate the kindness & caring nature of all the staff.I hope to come back in April again.Thank you,Miriam SandovalDirect: [--]\n",

      "  Review : This hotel was recommended to me by the local Atlanta chapter of a national organization called HEAL. If you suffer from environmental sensitivities (to fragranced products like Glade, fabric softener, or carpets freshened up with scented powders) you know it's hard to find a nontoxic hotel where you can actually open a window for some fresh air. Many hotels these days are completely sealed, with windows that don't open, and heavily scented cleaning products. It turns out that this hotel was recommended as a home away from home by a local doctor specializing in environmental medicine. At that time two of its suites had hardwood floors and he liked his patients to stay in those. Since that time the hotel renovated so all the suites have hardwood. This is not only beauitiful in my opinion but far healthier than carpet in terms of asthma-triggering dust mites, and easier to clean.I also love the hotel because they don't use heavy amounts of scented detergent and fabric softener, which literally make me sick. It's simply a pleasure to be in an elegant suite with pretty floors and a window I can crack open for fresh air while sleeping.I don't understand why more hotels don't emulate The Wingate. How many times have I gone from hotel to hotel trying to find one without heavy air freshener that makes me ill.This hotel also has really nice front desk personnel. I think they're happy working here and it shows.\n",

      "  Review : The reviews are spot on for the Wingate. The location, the price and the service have not been equaled by any hotel I've stayed at in the Atlanta area ... or anywhere else for that matter.From the check-in process to check-out, I didn't have a problem or a regret. The rates are better than the neighboring hotels. The service finer. The attention better. The rooms as good if not better. And the location, for me, was outstanding.Mr. Anthony is a great ambassador for the hotel. He made me feel like a friend he had not seen in some time and was on call when I needed advice on restaurants in the area. I was impressed that he remembered me and called me by name on my third day of the stay. But that was par for the course for this hotel. No add-ons. No noisy neighbors. Just good old-fashioned service and a good product. Thoroughly enjoyed it and will be back again when I'm in the Atlanta area,\n",

      "  Review : I'm a journalist and travel often so I've seen the best and worst of hotels. The Wingate is the best hotel in Atlanta and is unique in offering hardwood floors in the suites, windows that can be opened, and (very important to me) they don't use excessive air fresheners, fabric softeners, or scents that trigger my asthma. Everything is clean, without overly toxic \"fragranced\" stuff that I hate in other hotels. There is no mold, either, which can be a problem in some hotels. I love the hardwood floors in the rooms. The windows have a nice translucent shade and then a room darkener shade over that. The shower is hot and strong. The breakfast is sumptuous. There's a good desk and laptop hookup in the suite as well as a business center with two computers downstairs, fitness club, pool and sauna. Anthony is the Director of Guest Services and Monique is the front desk person by day and they couldn't be nicer. In addition the hotel is convenient to everything we like, including nice restaurants and a good Wholefoods.\n",

      "  Review : I chose this hotel based solely on the outstanding reviews it received on Trip Advisor. This is the first time I have ever been disappointed with a TA recommendation. Night One: Had to call maintenance because the thermostat didn't work. Then, the guest in the adjacent room was talking on the phone and we could hear EVERY word he said. Clearly. And he was not talking in a loud voice. We determined that his voice was coming in loud and clear through the door that connected the two rooms. I called the front desk and was told that I was the first person to EVER have this complaint. We were offered a chance to change rooms, but since it was past midnight and we were settled in, we passed. We listened to the conversation of the guest next door until 1:30 am. The guest checked out the next day and no one moved in, so the next two days were quiet on that side of the room. You could, however, hear street noise all night long and the housekeepers were quite loud each morning as they worked in the surrounding rooms. Day Two: I mentioned to the front desk clerk that we were paying $6 a night more per night for the AAA rate than the \"Best Available\" rate offered on the hotel's own website. I was told that only rates made through the hotel were guaranteed. I told the clerk I DID make the reservation through the hotel and he said he'd have the manager contact me. The manager didn't call me, but I saw him at the front desk when we were leaving for the day. I asked him about the rate difference and he said \"we'll talk about it.\" Never happened. Upon checking out, the express check out envelope stated the price guarantee. I felt this was a slap in the face, and I called downstairs before checking out. I again inquired about my rate difference, albeit it was only $18 total, but it was the principal. This clerk gave me all kinds of reasons why I wasn't entitled to the guarantee, but relented and promised to have the manager call me. He didn't.  Upon my return home, I realized that I had left my cell phone charger in room. I called the hotel and the woman told me she would check with lost and found and call me back. Four hours later, I called her and she said \"I told you we'd call you tomorrow morning. That's housekeeping you want, and they won't be back until then.\" I waited for the call until 1pm the next day. Then I called the hotel again. A different clerk, a man, apologized and said he'd check in to it right away and call me back. He gave me his cell phone number--just in case--but was on his way to find my charger. Forty minutes later, I called him back. He apologized and said that he checked and no, they didn't find the charger. So....the legendary service at the Wingate escaped me. The nightly rate was reasonable, but clearly you get what you pay for. The Wingate is a moderate hotel with average amenities. On the positive side, the internet service was fast and efficient. The complimentary limo service was top shelf and a God send, as we were in Atlanta during the unprecedented bitter cold weekend and would not have survived if we had to walk! The coffee in the lobby, however, was lousy and since neither one of us eats breakfast, I can't attest to the food quality. I would have much preferred to have a complimentary glass of wine in the evening! . The TripAdvisor reviews made it sound like the Wingate was higher quality.\n",

He was professional, accommodating, and such a joy to work with. As a bride, I felt like the entire event was in great hands. The complimentary limo rides to the mall, to dinner, and to the wedding itself were invaluable and made all of our guests feel extra special. The rooms are unique with hard wood floors and I highly highly recommend the suite! All in all, this was the best experience ever. I have stayed in much more expensive hotels, but not with this level of service and comfort. Did I mention that the breakfast is a full one - including made to order omlets!

      "  Review : My husband and I had arranged a stay at the Wingate by Wyndham for ourselves, as well as some immediate family and friends, for our Atlanta wedding this month. Though our stay coincided with a major football game and several conferences, they were able to accommodate all of us with rooms, even at the last minute. As soon as we arrived, the staff at the front desk were warm, welcoming, and extremely friendly. Even my father, who generally has a grumpy-old-man personality, was amazed at the courtesy of the staff, and sophistication of the rooms. The Manager and (appropriately named) Director of First Impressions worked with me throughout the few crazy days before the event, during, and even after the wedding, to ensure that I had everything I needed. He was even able to arrange a luxury shuttle to & from the venue for rehearsal.The night of the wedding, my fiancee and I stayed in the suite, which was lovely, comfortable, and included a very romantic four-post bed and jacuzzi! The only glitch we encountered was that we could not order food via room service, but luckily, the restaurant is in the heart of Atlanta, right next to some really fantastic restaurants. We were exhausted, but relieved at the comfort of our room.This is a very well-managed establishment, and I would recommend it for anyone who wants to stay in the heart of Buckhead, for business or pleasure.\n",

Obviously, we agree with all the stellar reviews or we wouldn't be repeat customers. These folks do everything right. The only problem we have ever had is the strange disappearance of the cappuccino machine. We are coffee lovers who experience a time change when visiting Atlanta. We consider a good cup of expresso or cappuccino a necessity, not a luxury, for functioning on Eastern Time. We do not like having to schlepp to Starbucks down the way for an overpriced cup of joe. We plead with you to please settle your squabbles with the manufacturer/distibutor of the current machine or just find a new supplier. The regular coffee at the breakfast bar just doesn't cut it.

      "  Review : We went to Atlanta with much hesitation and insecurity coming from a small town to a very large city. From the moment we arrived we got nothing but smiles, happiness, welcome and care. The complete staff from Front desk, to cleaning staff, drivers to maintanence, and bar tender were all very friendly and made you feel like you were at home, and a part of a family. Our room was gorgeous, very spacious and clean. The conference room was always stocked very clean, and on our timed breaks our water was all refilled and snacks where supplied. Breakfast was a great spread of a full american breakfast including custom made omletts or waffles. The location of the hotel was perfect, everything within a short walking distance, and if it wasn't the complimentary driving service would take you anywhere you needed to go. All in all it was very important to us to feel safe and comfortable at all times, and this hotel and it's staff went above and beyond anything we could have imagined. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling even remotely close to the Atlanta area. It truley would be a waste to stay anywhere else\n",

If there is one thing I can say about the Wingate it will be \"RELIABLE\", I know I can count on this hotel to take care of our clients. My clients rave about the Omelet station offered during breakfast, it has saved me money on buying food for breakfast during our meetings. My clients also love the Limo service they get, they feel like Kings without costing us a penny more. I definitely recommend those who are looking to stay in this area to call Anthony at Wingate and book your rooms there, you will save money while enjoying a top of the line service.\n",

      "  Review : We attended a wedding outside of Atlanta and then spent a couple days in Savannah. We returned to Atlanta and stayed at the Wingate the evening before returning to Dallas. My wife wanted to stay closer to the airport fearing traffic problems in the morning but our flight wasn't until 10:30 am and the reviews for the Wingate were very good. I am so glad we stayed here. The rates were very competitive, the hotel accommodations were terrific and the helpful staff made our stay very enjoyable. We arrived, quickly checked in and then went to the buisness center to search for a decent restaurant in the area. We picked four restuarants that peeked our interest and I then asked the front desk clerk what his suggestions were. We settled on Bone's - a excellent steak house. Even though we had a rent car the desk clerk said he would have someone drive us to and from the restuarant just call down ten minutes before we wanted to leave. Oh, and the desk clerk made our dinner reservations for us! Ten minutes before we left I called down to the front desk and when we got to the lobbly we were informed the drive was waiting for us outside. \"How perfect is this\", I said to myself as we climbed into the stretch limo!! I figured we be riding in the hotel van-what a terrific surprise. Dinner was absolutely wonderful and when we finished they called the hotel and the limo returned. We then got a nice little limo tour of some of the Buckhead residential areas on the way back to the hotel. This whole experience could not have been better at twice the price! Wonderful place, very pretty lobby, great room, great bed, friendly helpful staff...what else could you ask for.\n",

      "  Review : The many hotels I have stayed in are always clean and the staff are always friendly. However, this hotel never skips a beat when it comes to the \"consistency\" of customer service rendered to each guest at each visit I make to this particular hotel. Anthony the hotel manager is the best. He consistently gives 150% customer service to ALL of his guests. Under his direction, the staff follows his beat in providing each guest the treatment of royalty. The free hot breakfast served at the hotel is better than the traditional continental breakfast. A great treat! The social hour food is always hot and delicious and a great way to meet/network with other professional guests staying at the hotel. I always stay at this hotel every time I come to town on business and refer this hotel to everyone of my friends, colleagues and strangers new to the city. Keep up the good work Anthony and staff. I am and will always be one of your loyal guests.\n",

      "  Review : November 3, 2009Wingate by Wyndham3600 Piedmont Road NEAtlanta, GA 30305[--]I would like to thank the entire front desk staff for helping my husband to your hotel, checked in with no hassles, and to the Amtrak station all in a timely and most professional manner. My vocabulary does not contain the words I need to express how helpful the staff was to me. My husband took a flight from LaGuardia to Atlanta to handle a business matter. He suffers from seizures, and forgot to take his medication, which resulted in him having 2 seizures on Wednesday, October 28th. Once released from the hospital, I attempted to reserve a room for him at the Super 8 motel across from the Amtrak station so that it would be easy for him to get his train back home the next evening. Not only did Super 8 deny him entrance because he did not have the card I used for the reservation in his presence, but they had the audacity to charge my card as if he had checked in.During the entire fiasco, my husband suffered yet another seizure, and was taken to another area hospital. Upon the 2nd hospital releasing him on the morning of Thursday, October 29th, he had no where to go until his train left at 8:21pm that evening. I was reluctant to try to reserve another room with what had previously happened with Super 8, but I decided to call Wingate by Wyndham. Once I explained the situation, I was not only assured that my husband would be able to check in, but they also coordinated the transportation for him to get there. He had no problems checking in, was able to relax and recover from his ordeal, and was provided with transportation to the Amtrak station in time to catch his train home.As a wife, my nerves were on edge the entire time, but I can definitely say that the staff of Wingate by Windham helped me breath easy during a very difficult time. will recommend this hotel and its brand to any and everyone I know based on this experience, and would be delighted to use this brand for any future travel whether business or pleasure.My sincere thanks to the entire Wingate Staff,Jennifer Scott-Hawthorne\n",

      "  Review : (Copy of letter written to management) I recently returned home to Walnut Creek, California, after spending two fantastic weeks at your property on Piedmont Avenue. I have been visiting Atlanta frequently since February 2007, and have stayed at several properties in Buckhead similar to yours. Quite frankly, I have never had such an enjoyable stay anywhere, ever. Let me tell you about my latest Atlanta trip.Your hotel was recommended to me by Butch, a bartender at Johnny’s Hideaway on Roswell Road. I have learned over the years that Butch knows Atlanta well, and the absolute best places. My wonderful experience started when I spoke to Anthony, your General Manager, after I called to make a reservation and inquire about your rates. He was so friendly and charming that I was won over. I thought if his staff has been influenced by his attitude, I’m going to be well taken care of. So, I booked a room for two weeks.When I arrived on October 5, at 7:30 am, I was enthusiastically greeted by Monique (what a sweetie) at the front desk. I checked in, and went to my room with my bags. I realized there was no kitchen and this was not a suite. My fault. I had assumed there would be a kitchen from the description on the internet. I returned to the lobby and told Monique of my hesitation about staying for so long without a kitchen - I hadn’t planned on eating out for every meal. Without batting an eye, Monique invited me to have some coffee and breakfast, relax, and leave the decision about leaving for later that morning. She talked to me about the evening hors d’oeuvres, and tried to assure me that all would be okay. And, my breakfast would be on the house. I had just arrived from California on a red-eye flight, had no sleep, had taken a cab from the airport, and was exhausted. Monique’s kindness, TLC, and fabulous disposition was exactly what I needed.So, I went to the dining room, and there I met Berta, Deborah, and Roberto (mi amore), and of course the fabulous Theresa, and was treated to an omelet, coffee and the kindest, gentlest conversation ever. These folks were so nice to me, that I realized I couldn’t possibly find anything to match this experience. So I talked to Monique, said I wanted to stay, and she was just as pleased at my decision as she could be. Make no mistake: I stayed for two weeks because of Monique’s handling of this situation, and the dining staff’s treatment of guests.And, it just kept getting better from there. Marquis, who is so enthusiastic that his genuineness, kindness, and sweet spirit are contagious; strong Chris, who made it clear that he and the staff would take care of me, no matter what; and my pal Alan, who I occasionally saw in the middle of the night as he worked, never skipping a beat as people came and went. Who would have thought a quiet hotel had so much action all night long? And, what a love he is - always kind, always helpful to me and everyone with an annoying request at 3 am. And, of course, Herschel, so handsome and efficient.Etienne, strong and competent, served me wine and made restaurant recommendations for which I was grateful and passed on to my friends. He has chosen his inventory well, and the bar at the hotel is well-stocked. Additionally, I met some of Etienne’s family, and immediately felt like family myself. It doesn’t get any better than when Etienne’s sister sees me, and I get a big hug from her.While I didn’t get to know them well, your drivers - Ben, Craig and Farris -were polite, friendly, and gracious; I felt totally safe with Farris behind the wheel. I certainly appreciated your service when I had to relinquish my rental car. I didn’t get to know the housekeeping staff at all, but was grateful for the competent job they did every day in my room.Mr. Jokhi, I am sure you are aware of the high caliber of people you have on your payroll. And, I’m sure you are aware that they come to you fully formed - no one taught any of these people how to be kind, gentle, genuine, sweet, strong, and caring. They exhibit good judgment when left to their own devices, and take care of your guests and your property in a manner that must inspire envy in your competition. Someone has had the wisdom and talent to recognize these superior qualities, and to hire well. That person is of inestimable value to you, as the owner of this property.While I always have a good time in Atlanta, this trip was even more memorable because of the way I was treated by your staff. I felt cared for, appreciated, and genuinely liked; and, I couldn’t wait to see these people each and every day. I intend to recommend your hotel to anyone who asks where to stay in Atlanta.Mr. Jokhi, my credentials include having been a General Manger myself of a small hotel: a boutique property on Union Square in San Francisco. I know the hospitality business well. I know you will take care of the people who are entrusted to you as employees, and they will in turn take care of your guests and your financial future. They are the reason people come to The Wingate; they are the reason I can’t wait to come back. I think I finally know what people mean by “Southern Hospitality”.\n",

We were pleasantly surprised to find that not did the hotel and its staff live up to the good reviews that we had read, but surpassed our expectations. From the most enthusiastic greeting that we received from Marquis when we arrived to our check out, the staff seemed to go out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. An added bonus that we did not pick up on our research of the hotel's services is the shuttle. What a joy for we \"country folks\" not to have to navigate the traffic in the Buckhead area. The complimentary breakfast was superb! Where else can you get a made to order omelot on a free breakfast buffett?\n",

      "  Review : This night was saved from being a very bad one for me by extraordinary customer service- far above and beyond what was necessary. It is 1:30 a.m. and I am writing from my room in the Wingate, but I was not supposed to be staying here, my reservation was for the Hyatt Place Buckhead. My husband and I drove 11 hours to get here, and as we were not set to arrive until after midnight, I called the Hyatt Place around check-in time to make sure they would hold the room. The man I spoke to acted like that would not be possible, and I was a little taken aback (it brought the Seinfeld episode to mind- something like 'You know how to TAKE the reservation, you just don't know how to KEEP the reservation, which is the whole point of the reservation in the first place!' He explained to me that they were oversold and so I would be moved to the Hyatt Grand which was right across the parking lot, I would still have all of the amenities, I could still park in their parking lot, come over to eat their breakfast and their staff would take care of transporting my luggage back to the Hyatt Place tomorrow where I could finish my stay, and furthermore I should be happy because the Hyatt Grand is a \"much nicer hotel\". The reason that this was happening to me was because I was arriving late and because I had booked through Hotwire. Of course, if I had booked directly with them I would have not had this inconvenience. I'm still not sure why hotels think it's okay to treat customers who take advantage of these services like second-class citizens. I don't always book through third party sites, but the way I'm treated when I do definitely influences how I feel about a hotel chain.Although it was not the end of the world that I would have to move hotels, it was definitely an inconvenience. First, it's 1 a.m. Second, we are traveling with a large amount of luggage due to our profession, and we have meetings all day tomorrow, which meant we would likely have to store our luggage in our car in between check out of the one hotel and check in of the other hotel. We also already have to move hotels in the middle of our stay in Atlanta due to other reasons, so now we have to move twice.To add insult to injury, upon arrival at the Hyatt Place, the lady behind the desk was quite abrupt and completely unsympathetic to our situation. I felt like she acted like we did not deserve a room there. For me, even just an \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience\" would have gone a long way for me. Furthermore, we would not be moved to the Hyatt Grand, but instead the Wingate, a mile away. Now, I'm really ticked, because I chose to stay at the Hyatt Place (I knew it was this hotel when I selected it through Hotwire), due to it being across the street from the Intercontinental, where all of our meetings are. There's nothing I can do, so we get in the car and drive to the Wingate, not expecting much.Well, this is where the story changes. We were greeted warmly by Hershel Washington who promised to make our displacement as painless as possible. Mind you, this situation was in no way his fault or his problem. I have never experienced customer service like this. He truly became the hero in this situation. Literally, our every wish was granted (and more). Could we have late check-out? Done. Could we have a king bed? They didn't have any available- so he upgraded us to a gorgeous two room suite with a spa tub. He solved every problem we had- offered their limo so we could get to our meetings and to store our luggage while we waited to check in at the Hyatt Place. Offered to let us park in their private front spot so it would be more convenient for us to load our luggage. As soon as we walked in the room, the phone rang- it was Hershel checking to see if our room was adequate. (It is amazing!) Again the phone rang- were we hungry? We could come and get a snack and a drink from the sundries store on the house. We are now strongly considering paying far more than we intended to for this trip and staying in this room for the rest of the week. All because Hershel made us feel like we really mattered to him. That he really cared to have our business. I can see now why this hotel is one of the highest rated in Atlanta. They deserve it. I have never posted a review here before, and I'm very tired (it's not almost 2 a.m.) but I was compelled to tell someone about this extraordinary tale of excellent customer service.Thank you, Hershel, for making my night!\n",

      "  Review : Stayed here for 2 nights recently. Found hotel to be great. Requested a change of rooms due to noise from neighbours and was granted immediately without fuss. Rooms where very spacious and clean with all the facilities you could want. Breakfast in the hotel was excellent and above par for complimentary breakfasts. Found all the staff to be very polite and helpful. Location is great - nice safe area within a mile of 2 huge malls and a short drive from the centre of Atlanta. Would highly recommend staying here.\n",

      "  Review : Wyndham has some great staff that ensures exceptional service. The moment I walked in I could feel the warmth of their reception. Check in was swift along with a free upgrade to a suite. The person at the counter had all the details for check in and self ready by the time I approached the counter. He was also very helpful with providing directions and arranging for a car for my commute. This means a lot to a person who is new the city.Rooms are spacious, comfortable and well appointed. Rooms had everything that one could expect from a business hotel. Bathroom was huge and I could say just perfect.Breakfast has a nice spread and quality of food available was excellent. Would offer a prefect start for the day. The dining area could get a little crowded sometimes.My only issue with my room was the sound proofing of the room. In the middle of the night I could hear water being flushed and lot of noise. I almost woke up from my sleep thinking there some kind of a flood to realize the noise was coming from the adjacent room. I would recommend this place for anyone visiting Buckhead and for their lovely service.\n",

      "  Review : Checked-In on Tuesday, October 6th, 2009 - Checked out Wednesday October 14th, 2009. What worked as personnel?Monique, Anthony, Ferris, Benjamin, Charmine, and Marquis. That's it! Monique: 'Grade A'... she comprehensively understands how to facilitate and achieve the BEST results for the guest, consistently. Monique gets it 100% She will be tremendously success as she understands the delicate balance of professionalism and delivery of services within the context of quality.Anthony: Hard-working and aims to provide his clients the BEST service he can. A can do it all executor; competent in multi-tasking.Ferris: Does his job and does it well!Benjamin: 1st Class! Absolute core-essence in delivery of services.Charmaine: Delightful! Polite and enthusiastic, makes good Concierge recommendations.Marquis: Talented... he knows what works. He simply has to remember to remain focused on the tasks at hand and deliver and demonstrate as he knows he can. consistently... unwavering.What didn't work as personnel?Herschel, Etienne, Chris - these THREE spoiled the entire eight night (8) stay for all the others... bring the overall rating to a 'Grade D', just passing! .These three are pretty much in the same boat... Herschel = ABRASIVE and RUDE... Etienne... not well-educated, and does NOT understand that he is NOT in Johannesburg, South Africa.. He's in the United States. He MUST become learned and understand that ANYONE who is NOT happy with their services regardless of ethnicity is entitled to complain about what does NOT work! Chris... simply in over his head. Does not have adequate training to execute in his position. Becomes frustrated and then it all goes to hell in a handbasket!!! NOT good!The Internet did NOT work well at all. NOT even for one day. There were hours on end when the Internet did not work. When Monique efficiently connected me to their (pseudo) engineer Etienne, he complained to his management because I complained about the Internet not working for four (4) days... go figure? Yes, that's what Etienne did when I complained about the UNCEASING interruptions or ZERO Internet services. How out in left field is that? This hotel has the WORSE Internet services I have ever had and I have stayed in at least nineteen (19) hotel just this year for business. If Internet services are important for you... do NOT stay at this hotel. Do NOT! The Internet was for me a living NIGHTMARE!!! HORRIBLE! A HORROR SHOW!!! AWFUL!!!The owners, they left me with the impression that my stay was not important. When I had issues one afternoon with the shuttle and Chris was becoming flustered, they told him to tell me, “we are too busy with other things.” Great! Wow, is this how you wish to spend your hard earn money? With a hotel that doesn’t give a dam about the guest??? If any company is NOT prepared to do what is necessary for a guest spending close to U$1,000.00 for seven/eight nights, and they offer services which do NOT work… then that’s UNACCEPTABLE! You can spend your money elsewhere.I am prepared to go on YouTube, Facebook, Myspace, Expedia, and Blog about how this hotel handled my stay. When enough people check in at other hotel brands - properties, they will understand the modicum of what is required when a hotel posts services that must work. They MUST function... and when they do NOT have a smiling and courteous face... working with the client to realize alternatives rather than complaining about a paying guest requesting what they advertise in their brochures and on the Internet.\n",

      "  Review : My daughter and I traveled down to Atlanta to tour Emory University over the Canadian Thanksgiving weekend. After checking on trip advisor, I chose to book at The Wingate by Wyndham- Buckhead and I have to say I am so glad that I did. Before our stay, I couldn't quite fathom how a hotel could have so many 5 star ratings from previous guests but after staying here, it is clear to me that this hotel, its management and staff are truly special. From the minute you enter and are greeted by Marquis at the front desk you feel that you are among friends. He makes you feel so special, that you are the most important person in the room. He doesn't just do this as you check-in but during your entire stay. Everytime we came down to the lobby he asked how we were and wanted to know if there was anything we needed. Besides his genuine friendliness, he remembered the first names of every guest that came his way.How refreshing it is to be made to feel so important! But the fabulous customer service doesn't stop there. From Marquis, to the cook and the staff working the breakfast buffet, to housekeeping, to the bartender (marvelous martini and olives), Craig, Teresa and finally to the manager Anthony, I cannot thank you enough for your kindness, care and hospitality. I have stayed at 5 star resorts that didn't come close to the service that we received at the Wingate.I am hoping that my daughter goes to Emory so that I can come back to the Wingate on a regular basis, but even if she doesn't, we will most certainly return to enjoy the Buckhead area and above all The Wingate.\n",

      "  Review : My wife and I and some friends had the opportunity to stay at the Wingate by Wyndham Buckhead for 2 nights on 10/2 and 10/3 and had an exceptional stay. From the very start when I located the hotel based on reviews on Trip Advisor, I began an email dialogue with Anthony who is the poster boy for great customer service. He was able to answer all of my questions and provided me with a great rate for our stay. He was also able to provide tips on transportation to Turner Field, as well as organized our free (yep, free) transportation to Chastain for the Black Crowes Concert Saturday Night. Our limo driver, Craig, was fantastic and entertaining getting us there and back without me having to deal with driving, directions, parking, etc. It definetely made the concert that much more enjoyable. The room was bright, clean, and the bed was very comfortable. The entire property was clean and well kept, and every associate we ran into was great (we even got greeted by Marquise by name each time we passed the front desk). Breakfast was an extra bonus and was all fantastic, especially the waffles. The location is convenient and easy to get to anywhere you're needing to go. I'll certainly stay at this property on my return trips to Atlanta and will not be considering any of the Marriot properities that I've stayed with for years. Thanks to Anthony and all of his wonderful staff!\n",

Being a mother of the Groom and not having to sweat the small stuff that Anthony and staff took care of was worth a pot of GOLD. Thanks to them our son's wedding was something to always remember. Will not stay anywhere else in Atlanta.... this place was great.\n",

Also included is a hot breakfast with bacon, sausage etc. and omelets to order! There is free limosine service that will take guests anywhere within 3 mile radius of the hotel! There were appetizers in the bar area at night and cookies in the lobby in the afternoon. This place is incredible for the price. Also, I want to mention the excellent staff. Anthony at the front desk upgraded me to a suite when he found out I recommended this hotel to the groom's family. After checking it out, they agreed this hotel was the best choice for everyone.Everyone at this hotel was extremely nice and welcoming.

Well, just give the Wingate by Wyndham in Buckhead a try...you will be hooked. My co-workers and I have been staying at this hotel for over three years when traveling to Atlanta. We all know the staff very well and they take good care of us. Why? Because they take good care of everyone that walks through the door the same way as us. Another reason customer service is so good is lack of turnover...we have worked with the same staff for the entire three years plus. The hotel speaks for itself. Curb appeal, cleanliness, security; they have gone all out to ensure safety for everyone. Everything in the hotel is always clean and in tip top shape and the staff takes pride in the hotel being this way. Whether you are traveling locally or from afar you will not have one problem while staying at this hotel...guaranteed.P.S. Don't forget to try out the free breakfast every morning as well. It is an added bonus that is a great start to each day!\n",

That would have been enough, but then we found a staff that sincerely wanted to help address any requests we had. They also have a fleet of first class vehicles (2 limos, 2 SUVs) that will take you any place within three miles for free, which included the wedding church. These vehicles also make airport runs for a reasonable price. Their free breakfast included an omlet station. Anoher plus is a nice bar area which they kept open late on Friday and Saturday nights. Anthony heads a team of professional that made the hotel (of all places) a highlight of our wedding weekend. I've traveled for 40 years on business. This hotel has nice rooms and is a quality property, but what distinguished is its superb customer service.\n",

The Wingate by Wyndham Buckhead far exceeds the definition of \"customer service\". From the moment you walk in, until the moment you check-out, Anthony and Marquis will make sure that everything you have scheduled for your trip to Buckhead will be successful.

Ben, Ethan, Craig, Teresa, Ferris, Monique and everyone else at the Wingate really do go far beyond their \"job duties.\" Each one of them has their own personality and are willing to help out any way they can.

From check-in to check-out all of the employees went above and beyond to provide very personalized service with a smile. The room was clean, spacious, cozy and comfortable. The breakfast was more than adequate and comparable to that of the Embassy Suites brand. There was an evening guest reception with light snacks; fruit, cheese. crackers, meatball, chicken tenders, etc. Lennox Shopping Mall and Phipps Plaza are both in close proximity to the hotel. The value could not be surpassed for the amount that I payed for the reservation. I think that my $100 per night room rate was a steal. I felt really safe in the area, and will not hesitate to book again in the future when I return to the area.\n",

I have to say that taking into account the cost, this hotel is definately up their as one of the best we have stopped in. Service was 1st class throughout our stay. Marquis on the front desk deserves special praise for going that extra mile to make our stay more enjoyable. Whatever they are paying him isn't enough! Rooms where very clean and comfortable. The free breakfast buffet, although not having a massive selection to choose from, was very good. Having an omlet chef ready to make your choice of omlet wasn't what i'd expected. Staff helped with suggestions on places to visit and restaurants to eat at. They offer a shuttle service which will take you to any venue within three miles of the hotel. This is sufficient to take you to the Marta transit system which will take you into Atlanta centre. There are a number of good quality restaurants nearby that the shuttle will take you to and pick you up from. We were very surprised on using the shuttle for the first time to fing that it wasn't the usual 'bus' that most hotel use but in fact a stretch limo. I'm amazed that there was no extra charge for using this service. Thanks for a memorable stay.\n",

      "  Review : Whether being greeted upon check -in or when returning back to the hotel after a day of work, the front office staff and guest services manager welcome guests with sincere enthusiasm, calling each by name. It made me feel as if I were coming home at the end of the day. Requests were handled expeditiously. This hotel is well-managed. Breakfast is a also delicious convenience provided each morning - always ready by 6 AM for early travelers!\n",

      "  Review : This is probably the friendliest hotel we have ever stayed in. Having read that this was 'the best' hotel in Atlanta, we had very high expectations and we were not disappointed in any way.The rooms are a reasonable size, the beds are dreamy, the bath was a bit low, but hey!The breakfasts would cater for any taste, bagels, toast, cereal, yoghurt, muffins, pastries, etc. or waffles and omelettes cooked fresh to order.We didn't have a car so were dependant upon the courtesy car at the hotel. We were driver around most of the time in a stretch limo!! Nothing was too much trouble for the drivers or for the reception staff. In fact every member of staff was absolutely charming.Complimentary cookies, coffee and juice are available throughout the day in the hotel atrium.We found the position of the hotel ideal, we always felt safe and we walked around the area a lot. Travel on the Marta, it is really a good way to get around the city and very cheap.We would go back tomorrow and would recommend this hotel to anyone.\n",

      "  Review : I booked the hotel for my husband's birthday that included a Steely Dan concert. I have stayed in 5-star hotels, but this one gets the best all-around award for appearance, hospitality, service, food and value. I couldn't believe it included a free limo ride to and from the concert and a fabulous breakfast buffet the following morning. Marquis was so warm and attentive and Anthony saved the day. I had failed to book a dinner reservation and he got us into one of the best restaurants in Atlanta. These two guys are amazing. They could run how-to serminars on customer service.\n",

Then we relaxed and had a drink and snacks at the Managers reception after swimming in the pool. The Breakfasts were delicious, homemade omelets, fresh fruit. Limo service to our restaurant and back and to the Marta station. Nice, clean rooms, very stylish. I wouldn't of changed one thing! The staff was above the bar! Marcus made my kids laugh and it was fun staying at this hotel. Craig was nice company while driving in the Limo.\n",

      "  Review : This is the third time we have stayed at this property. I cannot speak highly enough about the friendliness, competence, and helpfulness of the staff. I have stayed at the \"real\" 5-star properties and I can honestly say that this staff measures up in every way. The rooms are spacious and the beds are comfortable. The bathrooms are clearly not 5-star but they are adequate. We opted out of the free breakfast as it did seem quite the ordinary \"free breakfast\" fare (and there are other great places like Murphy's to enjoy breakfast in Atlanta). But the value simply cannot be matched. Unless the property itself is the main attraction to your Atlanta visit (in which case the Ritz is a beautiful hotel), I would highly recommend staying at the Wingate.\n",

They made my stay so home warming that any time I come to Atlanta, this will be the \"only\" hotel I will stay at. The complimentary transportation to my to the hotel lobby to everything affiliated with this hotel, is is far beyond a five star hotel in my book. As long as Marquis, Anthony and current staff are here, I will always return to this hotel as my second home.\n",

      "  Review : As a frequent traveler with at least 100 nights a year in a hotel, I vote the Windham-Buckhead as my favourite hotel. When I am staying at this hotel, I feel totally safe and taken care of. The staff in this hotel makes a very good hotel a GREAT hotel. This hotel is the best managed hotel I have ever been to. Anthony , the most friendly, hands-on manager should be congratulated on how to get every member of their staff motivated for their excellence in customer service and guest relations. The genuinely friendly staff seems to know everybody by name, is extremely helpful in any matter.Housekeeping is excellent and the breakfast staff makes sure that you get an extended breakfast (Heriberto even makes freshly made omlettes) included with the room. The front desk-what can I say! Not only does everybody do everything with the biggest smile, but their sense of humor is contagious. As far as I am concerned, Marquis should have his own Television show. I could just sit in the lobby and listen to him relate to the guests.Another excellent feature is the complimentary limo rides with within 3 mile limit and the airport transportation in the limo for a great rate.Thank you for making me feel so welcome and taken care of. You remember my name, I want to make sure all of you are mentioned here. This type of work ethic has to be recognized. Anthony Theresa Deborah Berta Herbierto Ben Craig Farris Charmaine Marquise Chris Bonn Julisa Sorry if I missed somebody. Thanks to all the staff that worked behind the scenes.See you in September\n",

      "  Review : Read many of the reviews and booked this hotel for a concert weekend in Atlanta. Anthony and his staff did not disappoint. Rooms were nice and comfortable, stayed on the main road side and did not notice the noise. As advertised, there was complimentary limo service to Chastain Ampitheatre, which was a big plus for my group as we were going to the Steely Dan concert. The complimentary breakfast was substantial including made to order omelets and waffles. Staff was very helpful in directing us to the local nightlife including the East Andrews Pub area just a few minutes away, and a 24 hour diner one block away. Through my mistake , we needed to change rooms and the staff was very attentive and happy to oblige. Again, with the limo, nightlife, and location, this is the best set-up for a concert I have ever seen. Thanks for a great weekend, I will be back\n",

Housekeeping didn't show up until 5:00 pm the second day we were there. The room was near the ice machine so it sounded like a vacuum cleaner was running all night. The room was also near the front of the hotel which is on a very busy street and I felt like I was trying to sleep at the Daytona 500.; earplugs the second night helped, but the first night was the worst night's rest I have ever had at a hotel.

The regular driver was out and the manager, Anthony, personally collected us to avoid any delay. They continued to provide us with an excellent service in the hotel answering our questions and giving us advice on restaurants and tourist attractions. The shuttles were a very nice 'extra' and they were even willing to take us to the nearby Atlanta History museum and then collect us and take us to Buckhead MARTA station.The staff were always friendly and attentive and the breakfasts substantial. The attractive rooms were spotless and had everything you could ever want. I do suggest that you ask for a room at the back if road noise bothers you. The pool was well maintained and a welcome facility in the Atlanta August heat. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel as I could not fault anything.\n",

      "  Review : We moved to this hotel after two nights in the Intercontinental Buckhead purely beacuse it was half the price. The staff at reception were excellent and so friendly particularly Marquise. The rooms with their hardwood floors were spotless. I was very pleased that we had chosen to stay in Buckhead (which is an upmarket suberb of Atlanta) rather than downtown or midtown. It was very convenient for the Atlanta History Centre and the excellent Lennox Square Shopping Mall.While the rooms and friendly service compared very favourably with the Intercontinental the rest of the hotel was much more low key. The pool was very small and rather unattractive -ok for a quick swim to cool off but not somewhere that you would want to sit all day. The breakfast was served in the bar/lounge area and was ok. Parking was free.The hotel was excellent as a base but if expense was not an issue then I think that I would have preferred to stay in the Intercontinental.\n",

I needed a room in Atlanta area and booked the Wingate based solely on reviews in Trip Advisor. I could not have been more pleased. They upgraded us to a suite as we were celebrating our anniversary, but even without the upgrade the staff is so friendly, the location is great and the hotel is so worth what you pay. The limo shuttle is icing on the cake. My only regret is that my wife's plane was delayed about 5 hours so instead of having the afternoon and evening to explore Buckhead we only had time for a late dinner. I look forward to returning and will stay here again and again.\n",

They even accmmodated us with a pack-n-play for our 1 year old. When we asked them for suggestions on dinner - they not only recommended an excellent restaurant, but they made the reservations for us and even offered to have their driver take us to dinner & pick us back up. They don't shuttle you around in a shuttle bus either - they have very nice Escalades & even a Limo for your transportation needs. Wingate goes above & beyond when it comes to customer service. There is also a nice bar near the lobby with plenty of seating where you can look out at their outdoor pool. Oh and I can't forget the breakfast - really good waffles & omlets.

      "  Review : As an Executive Chef and 20+ year veteran of the hospitality industry, I know what to look for when it comes to hotel service. Though not fully perfect (what is?), the Buckhead Wingate is very, very good at what they do. Every guest is treated like a VIP.Cleanliness and housekeeping was excellent. Plenty of towels, high quality bathroom toiletries. Asthetically pleasing room with wood floors, nice colors, good quality bed and linens. Pool and hot tub area very nice and quite attractive, especially at night.Food quality at breakfast was pretty good, especially considering it is included in the room rate. Get up early to avoid the breakfast rush!Front desk called me by my name our entire stay-nice personal touch without feeling a sense of \"forced\" kindess, always felt very genuine. Marquis was very helpful with our special requests for extra towels and disposable plates and cutlery for our room. Craig at the desk and Anthony the manager were great and helped me locate an item left behind in our room after we returned home.Complimentary limo rides were fun and efficient. Blew the kids away, made them feel like celebrities. If I wanted to be picky, the only negatives I could point out were that the alarm clock function on our clock did not work (I reported this on check out, but was not really in need of it during stay) and with such a nice room, why leave a plain pvc ac drain pipe exposed without some sort of covering? Queen beds would have been a nice bonus, but the doubles were really not uncomfortable at all. I researched atlanta hotels exhaustively and was blown away by the reviews, especially when compared to the value pricing of the room. Wingate should be proud to have such an excellent property in their portfolio!Definitely recommended, These folks care.\n",

      "  Review : We stayed at this Wingate for 5 nights while on a family vacation in Atlanta. The hotel itself was very nicely appointed- from the marble and hardwood in the lobby to the marble and hardwood in the rooms. The from desk staff was very outgoing and friendly- especially Marquis and Craig. We were traveling with two young boys and they were always interacting with the boys and offereing cookies. The hot breakfast was excellent and we loved the cappacino machine that was available all day to the guests. The breakfast staff was very nice as well. The workout room was nice and up to our expectations.The complementary limo ride within a 3 mile radius was very nice, although we didn't partake because of the small children. We found the ladies who cleaned the room and the bartender to be very friendly as well. The rooms were very nice and high-quality. Marble in the bathroom and hardwood floors. It was nice to have a microwave and fridge as well. The location of the hotel was very convenient to shops, restaurants, and just a short drive to the downtown attractions. Also, it was nice to have free parking. I might suggest them cleaning up the hottub/pool area to bring it up to the same standards as the rest of the hotel. It was a little dingy and dirty but still usable. Overall-this hotel was an outstanding value, especially for the area. We definately would stay here again and recommend it to others.\n",

      "  Review : I stayed for five nights in the Wingate and had a very pleasant experience. The staff was wonderful, always smiling and accommodating. The hotel has a complimentary limo service, which was very useful (within three miles of the hotel); the drivers were exceptionally helpful. There is no room service or restaurant at the hotel, but there are a few places to eat within walking distance, and within a few miles there are several more (and a shopping mall). They have a small computer room (2 computers) with free internet for guests and what looked like a nice workout room on the ground floor, as well. My room was clean and included a couch, desk, microwave, and mini-fridge. I was traveling alone, so safety was a big issue for me, and I felt safe here (I did not walk around late at night, but I did walk to the nearby restaurants for dinner), and the hotel itself seemed pretty secure. All in all, this appears to be one of the more affordable options in Buckhead, and the hotel excels in customer service overall.\n",

      "  Review : We stayed two nights here and loved it! The room was spotless! I loved the hardwood floors! The bedding was just like home! Bathroom was large and super clean!! The hotel is close to everything. Lenox Mall is a 5 minute drive. Downtown is a 10 minute drive. There are many resturants close.There is a great free breakfast served in the mornings, a small fitness room, lovely pool, and fresh cookies in the lobby all day long!I will always stay here when visiting Atlanta!\n",

      "  Review : My company uses the Wingate in Buckhead each month as lodging for our business courses. I have spent one week per month at the Wingate since last July. During my first stay, I instantly felt like family. The manager, Anthony Hines-Tecoy, is the most helpful and outgoing hotel manger I have ever met. He always makes sure everything is going well, and he often always upgrades my rooms (if available). Marquis, Alan, and Etienne are also helpful. Marquis and Alan work at the front desk, and they are always happy to assist. Etienne performs general maintenance issues (QUICKLY!) and handles the bar area (which is always a plus after a long day at work!). The Wingate is truly my home away from home, and I could not ask for a better group of people to see each month! :)\n",

      "  Review : All the positive reviews I read before I stayed here are true. This is not a fancy or upscale hotel, but it has everything a traveler needs and the service is second to none. I checked in late at night and Marquis was friendly, personable and efficient. My first room had a door to the adjoining room and I could hear conversation coming from the other room. I went back downstairs and Marquis immediately switched me to another room and that was perfectly quiet. The room was spacious and well laid out, with two queens, work desk, reclining easy chair. I hadn't had dinner yet so Marquis gave me a bunch of menus of restaurants nearby that deliver (mostly Chinese and Italian) and I ordered in. In the morning, there was an excellent free hot breakfast, and I'm not talking prefab eggs and paper plates. There was a chef making great omelets, as well as all the usual cereals, toast/bagel/English Muffin, etc. Real plates and glasses. Free parking and internet. Small convenience store behind the reception with snacks and drinks. Only negative for me was a very small workout room with only one treadmill and bicycle. Within walking distance to restaurants; we walked 10 minutes to Roy's and had a great dinner.\n",

      "  Review : I was part of the BMMI conference planning team. We orginally planned for a conference of 35 to 50 indivduals. Calls and encouragements went out and our conference grew to 90. After arriving at the hotel the night before the conference, we quickly figured out we had out grown the conference facilities at the hotel. The conference was to start the following evening at 6:00 pm. The next day, the manager on duty Anthony Hines-Tecoy went above and beyond the call of duty to help our planning team find a facility which could handle our needs We were able to secure a venue without notice within 2 hours of making the request . When we made a request they made it happen. (Limo Shuttles to and from the conference facility, Hospitality suite accommodations, and hotel reservations). On behalf of the Planning team from Augusta, GA we want to thanks the following people.Hotel Owners: Freny & Burgess JokhiManager: on duty: Anthony Hines-Tecoy Front Desk: Monique Hospitality: Miss Teresa, Mr. FM, Breakfast Staff: Herbierto, Debra, BerthaTHANKS to all staff who names I didn't mention who worked behind the scenes to make this an enjoyble event.THANK YOU!!, THANK YOU!!!

Maurice will usually greet mewith a cookie and a smile. The rooms are bigger than most other Wingates with wood floors and a throw rug in each room. A cool little bar for the guests with top-shelf offerings. Their shuttle/limo makes getting around local Buckhead a breeze, and safe.Can't go wrong here and the best price in Buckhead.\n",

From the front desk with Marquis and Jessica to Ben, the Shuttle driver to Anthony the manager, this has been one of my most pleasant experiences.For those of you who do not know the Wingate, they have a omelet station at their breakfast. It is more than the typical \"free\" breakfast. The room I had was spacious, had a refrigerator and a microwave. They have a shuttle that takes you anywhere up to three miles. It takes you to the MARTA and for $4 you have a twenty minute ride to downtown Atlanta.I do not know if all Wingates are the same way but I will find out.\n",

He is simply a wonderful host and his level of commitment to taking care of the guest is second to none and this clearly filters down through all the staff who maintain Anthonys values and sense of service. My only warning here is the Hotel better give Anthony a raise and promotion soon this is one guy that they wouldnt want to lose. Go to Wyndham by Wingate at Buckhurst and prepare to ENJOY!\n",

      "  Review : We arrived for a 2 night, 3 day stay. Anthony, the hotel manger, went above and beyond. The hotel shuttle picked us up from the airport-2 different airlines and both planes late. The next night he arranged for the shuttle to take us to pick up our clients from a different hotel and take them to dinner. And lastly, he himself, picked us up from our meeting place AFTER we had checked out and took us to the train station.The hotel was everything we expected. Clean, quiet, beds were comfortable. Internet fast and free. Have not ever stayed at a Wingate before but as I travel for business I will start checking them out everywhere. If only Anthony could be in all the different cities.\n",

He recommended some excellent restaurants. He always made us feel special. Etienne, the bartender, makes great martinis and is fun to chat with. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was very good. The parking on site was free, but they also shuttled us to and from anywhere in Buckhead within a 3 mile radius. The drivers were very nice and we never had to wait very long. We understand why this hotel is rated #1 on trip advisor. We would absolutely stay here again if we return to Atlanta.

The complimentary breakfast was very good, lots to choose from with a personal chef to boot! Omelets and eggs cooked to your order. There is a small bar adjacent to the dining area. Very affordable, awesome deal for the money. Free parking on site.We were down for a couple of the Braves games. The hotel is about 10 miles from the ballpark but it is an easy drive. There are several nice local restaurants within walking distance (2 blocks) from the hotel. The Landmark Diner is open 24 hours and has a great selection from the menu and awesome desserts! Marcello's Pizza and Subs was great. We had lunch there and the pizza was delicious.You can't go wrong staying here. We will definitely stay here on our next trip to Atlanta!\n",

Being driven to the restaurants and collected in the fancy cars was a treat too. Room was clean, roomy and quiet. Breakfast was plentiful and tasty, especially the waffles made fresh each morning. Buckhead is a great base to explore Atlanta, (residential/business area). The Marta station is only a 10-15 min walk or the drivers at the hotel will drop you there, great for sightseeing and ideal for going back to the airport also if you don't want to take a taxi.\n",

From the minute we walked in the door to the minute we left, we were treated with 5-star service. The rooms had wood floors, the bed was wonderful, and the soap and shampoo were from Penhaligon. The staff opened the bar early simply because we said we were thirsty! We had several choices for dinner, and the staff recommended one a few blocks from the hotel.

      "  Review : WARNING: The pictures of the bathroom on the hotel’s website do not look like the actual bathrooms you will encounter (and unfortunately, these were the tipping point in my decision to reserve this hotel). They appear to be nice, big marble showers with glass doors (DOORS! YAY!) but in actuality the bathroom is not even on par with other hotels of the 3-star variety. It is a simple tub and shower curtain, and the bathroom is INCREDIBLY small. The pictures on the hotel’s website are undoubtedly in the suites or handicapped rooms, but of course, they do not disclose this. The caption merely reads “Bathroom”. There is not enough room for two people to stand side by side at the single sink and see the mirror. The room is as deep as a standard tub, the sink and counter span the entire length of the opposite wall, and there is just enough room for a toilet between them and room for the door to open into the bathroom.  Cons:GROSS stuff growing from bathtub overflow drain and down into the tub (and it wasn’t a stain, it moved with the water flow), mildew in the shower (seriously, how do maids not know to carry a bottle of bleach on the cart?), no conditioner in the toiletries kit although they still have funds for shoe mitts and shower caps, lamps didn’t work, only one nightstand for King bed (doubtless because the room’s so small), BOTH phones in room didn’t work (making it pretty darn difficult to call the front desk), hairdryer only blew cool air, the iron burned (and ruined) my shirt in less than a second and then later fell apart, the office chair won’t stay set and gradually rises up to the maximum height trapping your legs under the desk, the computers in the main business center downstairs (only two of them) both were out of order, stained sofa in the room, maybe the worst thing of all was rolling shades over the window (no curtains at all) that do not even come close to covering the window so you haven’t the smallest hope of sleeping late, NO laundry facilities of any kind available (self-service or otherwise). Pros:Breakfast is ok… not fantastic. Standard cereal (although only healthy cereals, no Froot Loops, Corn Pops, etc.), bagels, yogurt, omelets, and waffles (although the man who will make these for you—no self service—can be hard to locate at times). Good coffee/espresso/cappuccino machine although it may be only available at breakfast. They offer a complimentary shuttle for a 3 mile radius. I think I like the idea of laminate floors—you can see if the room’s been cleaned or not, although these floors looked super cheap. The shower head was really good. The staff did seem helpful with the exception of the maid, although that may have just been a language deficiency, and the front desk attendant that finally got one computer in the business center up and running and didn’t seem the least bit concerned that the other computer might need to be fixed so other customers could use it. Free parking and free internet access (although it had a poor signal in our room and we could never actually get on the internet). A little about myself: I am not wealthy, but am not poverty-stricken either. I am not a nitpicker looking for something to complain about--I am fine with a clean room, but I get frustrated with sloppiness, lazy attention to maintenance, and misrepresentation. I cannot in my wildest dreams figure out how on earth this hotel is #1 on the Tripadvisor list. I reserved it over a hotel that I had previously had a great experience with (the Omni at CNN) solely because I trust Tripadvisor’s system and my fellow travelers’ reviews. I now will question heartily any recommendation I see on Tripadvisor and I’m sad about that. The only explanation I can think of is that this hotel was very, very good when it was first opened, but has not done anything to maintain that since and is sliding into disrepair and mediocrity. It is certainly not worth the rate I paid, and in no way deserves the #1 slot on Tripadvisor in a city of so many hotel options.\n",

On our first night in Atlanta, we stayed downtown because it was \"walking distance\" to the Georgia Aquarium but I was unhappy with that hotel so we decided to go into Buckhead to stay at the #1 rated hotel. First of all, the drive from downtown to Buckhead is very easy and short. I regretted not staying at Wingate by Wynham from the start because parking for the Aquarium and nearby attractions was only $5 in a garage that I felt very safe with. The parking at Wingate is free which was nice compared to the $30/day parking downtown at hotel.The staff here was so friendly. The room felt comfy and bright and CLEAN. The bathroom was so clean with nice tile on the floor. Plenty of closet space and comfy beds with fluffy pillows. Close to malls and easy hop to the highway to go downtown. The complimentary hot breakfast was so nice. Made to order omelets and waffles. Quiet and peaceful feeling in hotel. Great value!\n",

The Wingate is large enough to have amenities like a pool, business centre and fitness room and small enough to feel personal. The staff were outstanding--helpful, pleasant, friendly. The rooms are nicely decorated with everything you could want and are kept spotless. The hot breakfast was lovely. And the transportation service was excellent. Not only did they take me to or pick me up from various places several times a day, it was in a beautiful vehicle. And as a woman travelling alone, I felt very safe, not just a room number but a name and a person to the staff. This place will be the standard by which I rate any other hotel.\n",

      "  Review : This was only my second trip to Atlanta and my first one wasn't good, so I was determined to see the nicer parts of the city. I am told Buckhead is about as nice as it gets. Indeed, it seemed like a very safe part of the city and I was very happy with the location. There were several much more expensive hotels like the Ritz nearby and I am sure those hotels are more luxurious, but the location is the same. The room was a standard Holiday Inn-style room, but it was clean, bright, and modern. I was very pleasantly surprised. I had stayed at a Wyndham Garden before and had a decent experience, but this was even better. No one will mistake this hotel for a luxury hotel, but for a business traveler or a vacationer who isn't seeking luxe spa treatments and a grand swimming area this hotel was a great base from which to explore Atlanta. I would return again as long as the rate was about $150 or under. I believe I paid something like $109 including tax and I have paid that much to stay at a crappy Hampton Inn off the highway. This was much better than that.\n",

This Wingate doesn't shuttle guests in 15 passenger vans. They have a sleek fleet of black Lincoln Navigators for their guests. Ben, the driver, took my daughter and her date to the Prom location in his stretch Navigator - he made them feel like Hollywood stars. It couldn't have been more perfect.The room was beautifully decorated and comfortable. I especially appreciate the luxurious linens! My husband especially liked controlling the AC temps - he was able to get it cool enough to sleep like a baby.It was nice enjoy an evening cocktail at the Bar. We didn't stay long enough to use the fitness room or pool but both appeared to be extremely clean and well maintained.What I liked best has to be the staff - Anthony, Ben and Monique went out of their way to ensure we had a great experience!I highly recommend this hotel for your next trip to Atlanta (Buckhead).\n",

      "  Review : My wedding was last weekend and we used the Wingate as our primary hotel for family and friends based on it's Buckhead location and TripAdvisor reviews. What a smart decision! The service provided by the manager, Anthony, and his staff was unbelievable. It was the kind of service you would expect only celebrity/famous types to receive. Wedding weekends are hectic and last minute changes require a lot of flexibility. Fortunately, the hotel has a fleet of vehicles they use to shuttle guests. Anthony COMPLETELY eliminated the stress of organizing logistics and transportation because he accommodated all of our needs no matter how great or last minute over the course of the 3 days. He went above and beyond what could reasonably be expected of a hotel manager. I am very amazed and appreciative of Anthony's hospitality and graciousness. The Wingate's transportation resources were integrated in to our wedding plan from the beginning and Anthony no doubt played an important role in our wedding weekend running smoothly without an exorbitant cost. I recommend the Wingate without any reservation! Anthony WILL take care of you!\n",

      "  Review : I stayed in this hotl during a recent business trip to Atlanta. The room was sparkling clean, quite, and very pleasant. It included a couch and queen sized bed. The hotel provided a free breakfast, including a modest omelet and gourmet coffees. Parking was convenient and the hotel offered free shuttle service (in a deluxe stretch limo!) to nearby restaurants. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful. The Buckhead location was convenient to downtown and the north end of Atlanta. This hotel would be my first choice for return trips to Atlanta,.\n",

      "  Review : As a business traveler I've stayed in a lot of hotels. Really tried to tighten the budget and picked Wingate by Wyndham; booked online and was unsure of what I would find. Everyone on staff was absolutely great, hot meal in the morning, nice business center, exercise room, pool, (although I didn't use the last two) and my hotel room was updated, roomy, and offered upgraded amenities. I will stay there on my next trip to Atlanta.\n",

      "  Review : This hotel has definitely lived up to it's number 1 spot. I have often turned to Trip Advisor and a host of other sites for hotel recommendations and reviews, however, I have never written one myself. This is the first time and it's because the staff at this hotel deserve recognition for the outstanding customer service that they provide. Anthony, Marquis, Chris and two others (so sorry I can't remember their names) were ALWAYS pleasant and helpful with whatever our needs were. We were a group of 12, all women, all family joining together for a 3 day weekend. The hotel was immaculate, the free breakfast was really good (made to order omelets? wow), the free 3 mile radius shuttle (Escalade or Navigator limousine) and did I already mention the service? The atmosphere was so comfortable. I can honestly say that the staff greeted us with a smile and a hello with each encounter and the manager Anthony was SO helpful and accommodating to our group. It was an awesome experience. If you visit Atlanta and you're looking for a reasonably priced hotel that's nice AND clean in an awesome area...STAY HERE! It's going to be my location of choice whenever I visit.\n",

      "  Review : We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights. In the leafy Buckhead area of Atlanta the hotel at first glance would appear to be the usual chain . However, what we discovered is that they seem to have put a unique local boutique like feel to it. There appeared to be a mix of business people and holidaymakers . But the reception staff seemed to be able to welcome business people with a personal touch, remembering past guests and giving advice to people on vacation.Marquis, on reception we were sure was destined for a Broadway career!The rooms are large, shower, bath, desk, free wi-fi and of you don’t have a lap top, there’s a business centre. Breakfast is provided complimentary including fresh waffles and omelettes, made to order. Coffee and tea is available in the bar 24/7- cookies welcomed us back after a days sightseeing. Parking is free around the property. There was a small fitness centre and pool outsideA big positive is the free car service which takes you up to 2 miles from the hotel until 11pm. As the best places to dine are around Buckhead, it means you can have a drink and be picked up. The manager, Anthony Tecoy even took us one night to avoid a 10 minute wait for the car coming back. Thats the kind of service you get. Eating in the area- try the Horseradish Grill or Aria.Ask the bar man for a Captain Sully Cocktail- his own invention, a tasty, patriotic looking drink with a meaning behind it!If you want room service , valet or bell boys, then pay more and stay somewhere else, but we got a great deal booking directly and I would stay again if we were in Atlanta\n",

There are two features about this hotel that make it unusual: 1) no carpet in the rooms, instead the floors are wood with area rugs You almost feel like you are staying in someone's extra bedroom in a home rather than a hotel room 2) a lovely breakfast buffet that includes custom-made omlets and freshly made waffles The breakfast also includes scrambled eggs, bacon, a large assortment of cereals, fresh fruits, yogurts, juices, English muffins, bagels, delicious coffees and teas.\n",

      "  Review : Me and 3 colleagues traveled to Atlanta on business and were looking for a nice place in the Buckhead area that would fit into our limited expense budget. The Wingate met the price requirement and easily surpassed all other criteria we look for in a hotel when traveling. The good:*Breakfast - can't be beat. I'd pay for it, but fortunately for you (and me) it's free!*Check-in - smooth and quick.*Room - Love the hardwood floors, just feels much cleaner than carpet. Nice rug leading to the bed. *Bed - Comfortable with plenty of pillows.*Internet - free wireless*Bathroom - Clean and best of all, the shower is large enough that the curtain didn't touch me while in there (a big pet peeve, feels sooo nasty when it does! haha)*Service - Having a Cadillac Escalade take you and your friends around to a restaurant or wherever you want to go for free (a tip is nice for the driver) is great!*Location - you can walk to restaurants that are decent, safe feeling area.*Newspaper - a USA Today outside your room each morning, nice gesture and way to get the day started.Not so good:*Being nit-picky here but you can hear the traffic outside the room if you are facing the road. I thought it would be bad at night but the road is virtually empty at night so no issue sleeping.*Bar was a little pricey but what hotel bar isn't?As you can see, we all absolutely LOVED this hotel and wanted to stay longer. If I travel back down to the Atlanta area I will definitely stay here again as it is an impressive place, especially for the money.I read all the great reviews and was wondering if they were fake or not but trust me, they are spot on. Highly recommended.\n",

      "  Review : The hotel is located in the upmarket Buckhead area of Atlanta and is about 8 miles from downtown and the main attractions. The reception staff were exceptionally friendly and welcoming.The room was ok but a little odd in that there wasa recliner chair but positioned so you couldn't see the TV (which was an old tube model with indifferent reception) a large rug and then the bed resulting in a large open area which just seemed strange. I imagine they were aiming to create a work space/lounge space separate from the sleeping area, but it didn't work for me. The bed itself was comfortable enough but the linen was ludicrously fussy with a sheet, then a blanket, then a sheet, then a duvet - I ended up taking all the linen off and remaking it to be able to sleep. Mind you the blinds on the windows are so bad that light pours in all night so sleep isn't that easy. For no reason i could work out the roller blind is hung in such a way that there is about a 2\" gap between the blind and the window all around.Another reviewer noted that a connecting door in the room is so thin that you can hear everything next door and I concur - I had to knock on the wall to get the next room to turn down the TV, not that they had it so loud but the door may as well not be there for all the sound insulation it gives.The Wingate was adequate for my two nights in Atlanta but it wasn't cheap and I'm sure there are other hotels in more convenient locations in Atlanta which are better.\n",

Africa to India...and this stay ranks among the very top with regards to hospitality, service and graciousness. We felt like family. the staff was extrodinarily responsive to everyone ... including the more TENSE parents of the bride who wanted, demanded perfection. The staff went out of thier way to be helpful, calming and just soooo pleasent. The accomodations are spotlessly clean, intimate and easily accessible. Whether your looking for a small hotel to accomodate out of towners, or just a great place to be when visiting Atlanta for business or pleasure this is the place to be. And Anthony...the director of guest services! world class!\n",

      "  Review : We stayed at the Wingate for a single night. We were going downtown for a special exhibit at a museum the next morning, and didn't want to have to drive far for that.I had not stayed at a Wingate before, let alone this location. When we pulled up, I was a bit worried. It was right on a busy road. There was noisy construction nearby. Also, I was a bit worried that I've have lots of traffic to fight through in the morning to get downtown from Buckhead.As it turns out, none of this was true. Inside the room, even with the construction nearby, it was fairly quiet during the day and very quiet at night with no traffic noise at all. (Granted our room did not face the street.)Traffic was very light the next day even though it was during rush hour and we ended up at the museum much earlier than we needed to be there.The Wingate is an exceptional value for it's location and cost.\n",

      "  Review : Stayed at this hotel for two nights at the start of our holiday. It is in a good location and the staff are very friendly and helpful. If you do stay here try and make sure that you do not get a room with a connecting door. Our room did have a connecting door and we could not hear the television for the noise of the people in the adjacent room. They were not doing anything wrong but there did not seem to be any soundproofing and we could hear every word of their conversation. As we were so exhausted after our transatlantic flight we did manage to get to sleep. The next night the situation was exactly the same with the noise from next door. The breakfast was very good and again the staff were very pleasant. The bed was very comfortable.Would I recommend this hotel - I am not sure - I do not have anything against it but I am also not in a hurry to rush back.\n",

The breakfast in the morning was great, omelets and waffles made to order. An excellent business center with a full service copier, two computers and two printers. There is also a limo/car service available to take you anywhere within 3 miles of the hotel. Our only issue was the room; we were able to stay at this location for free due to trip reward points and decided to stay in the King Suite. This is a larger room then a King, however for the extra money you get a larger room but that is it. We were disappointed that the room only came with a 20 inch TV and our room did not have doors to separate the bedroom from the living room. Overall the experience was fine and would recommend it to others.\n",

      "  Review : We're grateful to Trip Advisor for putting us onto this hotel. We'd stayed in Buckhead before, but not here. If you want to pay for chandeliers, the Ritz-Carlton is very nice. Otherwise, try this.We reserved a double room, calling the hotel directly. (The reservation could be canceled without penalty until 4 p.m. the day of arrival.) When we arrived, we were upgraded to a suite, without asking, by enormously friendly front desk staff. (Everyone we encountered at the hotel over three days and two nights had the same attitude.)The room was large and clean, with a mammoth whirlpook bath and big separate shower. Two TVs, comfortable chairs, good-sized closet, comfortable bed... everything you want.We really liked the lack of the nickel-and-diming you find elsewhere. Wireless internet worked, fine, free. There's also a business center with computer and printer -- again, no charge. Local phone calls and long-distance connections are free -- unheard of these days. A workout room is included, no charge. So is a breakfast, including made-to-order waffles and omelets. And USA Today at your door.And there's a free shuttle -- van or limo, depending on the size of the group -- to anyplace within three miles. We used it to get to MARTA.During our stay (August 2008) , there was construction on the next block, which we heard in the morning. Aside from that, this is a heck of a value.\n",

The front desk is the best. The first night we had Alan. He was very helpful and suggested a great eating place right around the corner that was open 24 hours ( The Diner). The next night Marquis was at the front desk. You couldn't ask for a better host! Our cable went out because of a storm and so we sat in the comfortable lobby atmosphere for a while. Marquis offered us some playing cards (which I my family and I haven't done in years)! We had a good time. The hotel bar is also nice if you want a drink. The Bartender is also great! This hotel also provides a limo service free within 3 miles. I can't forget to mention the out of this world breakfast at this hotel. There is a great older gentleman that hosts the breakfast. When in Atlanta my family will stay here! I can't say enough about the hotel and staff!\n",

      "  Review : As with every hotel there are pros and cons, but I must truly state that this hotel is extremely overrated. I recently stayed from July 27 to Aug 2 based on the reviews I saw on tripadvisor and needless to say my stay was less than spectacular. Pros: morning breakfast with made to order omelets and great shopping in the nearby buckhead area. Cons: shower curtain had holes in it, toilet constantly ran after flushing, unable to get internet connection on my laptop while in the room and construction on adjacent lot woke me up every morning. All in all, not a completely horrible stay, but I don't plan on returning. Having stayed at hiltons homewood suites, the homewood suites up the street would have probably been more appealing with larger rooms and more up to date amenities, like flat screen TVs in the rooms (which this hotel didn't have).\n",

      "  Review : Once again, tripadvisor does not steer us wrong. This is a great hotel just outside Atlanta in the plush Buckhead area. The service the first thing you notice as the hosts are kind, friendly and help with everything. The free shuttle limousine service is amazing and the fact that they pick you up late night from neighboring areas is incredible for a city hotel. The rooms are spacious with granite countertops, a nice bathroom and a comfy bed. Cannot say enough about the breakfast as well with an omelette maker and a pleasant smile with a newspaper ready for you. Would not stay anywhere else....free parking as well.\n",

      "  Review : We had an excellent stay at this hotel on July 5th. When we arrived after a long day of driving, it was a relief to pull up to this GORGEOUS property surrounded by lush gardens and a cool fountain. Our room was not ready when we arrived(? not sure why as it was past 5PM) but the very friendly and courteous desk clerk, Marquise, I think, sent us to relax by the pool and have some cappuccino.This gave us time to notice how nice this hotel really was. Modern , SPOTLESS lobby and nice little pool/spa area outside. A few minutes later we were checked in and as we entered the elevator were greeted by the housekeepers and their supervisor who made us feel welcome. Our room was beautiful, immaculate, and hip. There was a microwave and minifridge and tons of pillows on the plush beds..For around $100, this was the best hotel deal I have ever gotten in any large city or anywhere for that matter. Later we decided to go out to eat and asked the desk for advice on where to go. They handed us a list of restaurants and their prices and cuisine and then told us they will drive us to any one within 3 miles of the hotel-almost all on the list- in the hotel's limo!!!!! How awesome!! For Free!!! [Make sure you tip these guys -they are great!!] We had a lovely dinner at a Spanish restaurant-called the desk who sent Anthony -also courteous and professional-to get us when we finished. The next morning, there was complimentary breakfast so we rose early and were expecting rolls and coffee, but instead were treated to chefs preparing plates of eggs, bacon, potatoes, danish, fruit ,even an omelet bar!!! It was delicious and we were treated as if we were the only guests by the friendly staff. I know I am gushing, but seriously, I have never had this good of an experience anywhere in the country!!! Flawless express checkout and free parking. What else could you want??? Stay here if you go to Atlanta- I hope all Wingates are this nice!!\n",

      "  Review : I stayed here with some friends for a concert and picked the hotel based on the location and the \"Limo\" service which I translated to mean shuttle service. As it turns out Limo meant Limo - all shapes and sizes. The drivers were all precious and very nice. The front desk group from Monique to Marquis made every effort to get to know us by name so they could greet us by name. The bartender is very nice and stays on top on a very busy bar. Anthony the hotel manager is on it as well - during our stay when we were in the hot tub, a group of girls there for a slumber party invaded the pool area and he was right there to speak with the chaperone to make sure we were not run off.I have stayed at the hotel several times since the original stay in May and I come thru Atlanta once maybe twice a month...I won't stay anywhere else.\n",

      "  Review : I hesitate to rave about this hotel, fearing a stampede. But I took the advice of other Tripadvisor reviewers and booked a one night stay to see a concert at nearby Chastain Park. The rate was downright reasonable. The staff could not have been more accommodating. The amenities, including hardwood floors in the room and a lobby bar, are what you'd expect to find at much higher-priced hotels. Try finding another Buckhead hotel that gives you free omelettes to order in the morning AND free parking. But the real clincher here is the fleet of limos parked outside that will take you wherever you want to go - for free - within a three mile radius. I plan to stay at this Wingate from now on, whenever I travel to Atlanta.\n",

      "  Review : Not perfect but a quality place to stay for sure. If your'e an out-of-towner and coming for the concerts at Chastain Park - take the limo- now that's nice. Don't have to worry about drinking and driving, plus you meet some nice folks. I found the desk staff friendly and when my AC went out; it was repaired within 20 minutes. There are less costly places to stay and some with similar amenities for the money; BUT if you want a nice place to stay while attending concerts at Chastain then this is the place.\n",

We booked the hotel because of the reviews on TripAdvisor (we consult this site every time we travel) and really enjoyed our experience. The hotel was in an easily accessible, convenient location. The hot breakfast was a great start to each day and the front desk staff were very attentive and friendly. We did use the limo transportation for dinner and both drivers (to and from) were kind and accommodating. One thing that we did not expect were the hardwood floors in the rooms (refurbishing still in progress) - a very nice addition and took away the fear of walking barefoot in the room! Thank you, Wingate, for a wonderful stay!\n",

      "  Review : After reading the reviews on Tripadvisor, we chose this at short notice. Buckhead is a great location in Atlanta. Using the MARTA it is easy to get around, espeically if you use the hotel shuttle service (they have a stretch limo!). This hotel is a bit further away from the shopping mall/restaurants. There is a bus stop near the hotel and the No. 5 takes you direct to Lindbergh Centre where you can catch the MARTA. Get a multi day pass (only availalbe at the train stations - use he hotel shuttle on Day 1 to get you to the train station, then buy the pass) - USD 8 for 1 day, 9 for 2, 11 for 3 and 12 for 4. Bargain if you are straying more than one day.The front desk staff were all great, and most helpful.The room was genreally OK. The big problem was the air conditioning. The unit is in the room, and it is VERY LOUD, even on low fan. We had to switch it off at night to sleep, so woke up rather hot.Also, this hotel does not have adequate double glazing to cope with the huge construction site next door. A bit of a shock at 7am for someone on vacation who wants to have a lie in!!Breakfast was OK, and they also had free internet access with printers.\n",

      "  Review : Just got back from a business trip to Atlanta and stayed at the Wingate for four nights. I read all of the comments on Tripadvisor and after seeing it for myself; I have to agree this is a great property. I found out the property owners also own a Limo car service so there are always upscale cars and drivers on a first come first served basis to take you to a nearby mall or a restaurant for dinner and then pick you up to take you back if you can’t or don’t want to drive.The room was comfortable and the bed was first class. The business center was top notch and the Internet connection both wired and WiFi is free. The included breakfast had a great variety with omelets, bacon, sausage, hot and cold cereal, great homemade style muffins, fruit, etc. The European coffee machine with all kinds of coffee was a nice touch. The cookies in the evening are also a nice touch. The desk staff is as good as it gets, always ready to please!The surrounding area is all business but there are two large malls that are just a few miles away. There is a Starbucks just half a mile away as well for us coffee lovers. There is a large Greek style diner that one could walk to, I ate there one night and the food was OK but I thought that $35.00 for a chicken pasta dish and a glass of table wine was excessive for a diner.Two small issues were it is illegal to make a left turn into the hotel so one needs to drive by it and make a u-turn which is a pain. The coffee for the coffee maker in my room was never replaced after the first day, and maid service was somewhat sloppy with coffee cups from the lobby never cleaned up. I'm sure I could have received more coffee if I complained but there is always coffee in the lobby night and day so I never did but it should have been replaced regardless.This is a great property for a business trip or Atlanta sightseeing. I managed to visit the Atlanta History museum which is just a few miles from the hotel and would recommend it.\n",

      "  Review : Wingate – AtlantaWe spent two nights (24/04 & 06/05) at the Wingate. Each time we had two rooms. I have to say I was hesitant (despite the reviews) – I guess I thought ‘what could be special about a chain hotel’ – but I was very pleasantly surprised – the reviews were true.Firstly check-in was quick and the receptionist was very informative, helpful and pleasant. The rooms were spacious and spotlessly clean. We used the limo service twice – which again I was expecting to be too good to be true – and guess what? It was true; the service was excellent & FREE!!!I also had the pleasure of meeting Anthony (the manager) – we’d communicated via email – he was as helpful and polite as I could have wished.The downside – the rooms on the back are noisy at the moment due to the early starting construction (about 3-00am on our first visit!). Also, on our second stay my parents were woken at about 2-30am by kids playing in the hot tub (I did report this to the receptionist on leaving, but she didn’t really seem interested), which was disappointing as all of the other staff seemed really attentive and proud of the service they provided. I would have expected the night receptionist to have put a stop to the noise as it occurred.Overall – a really good experience - my rating was only lowered by the two issues.\n",

      "  Review : My experience at the Wingate exceeded my expectations in every way! I see why it is rated the #1 hotel in Atlanta by TripAdvisor. We were there attending a music conference and will never stay at any other hotel. The rooms had nice hardwood floors, the beds were soooooo comfortable, the service was excellent, and the breakfast was far above the normal \"continental\" offered by most hotels its size. My friend and I never felt the need to have breakfast anywhere else. With all the amenities, you would have thought this was much larger and presigious hotel. They even have 2 limos and 2 state-of-the-art SUVs to shuttle hotel guests. My only regret is we did not get a chance to work out in the fitness gym, swim in the pool, or lounge in the hot tub. Now, they are owned by Wyndam Hotels. It will probably just get even better, if that is possible. :-) Hightly recommended! Stay there and enjoy.\n",

      "  Review : My boyfriend was working in Atlanta, so I went down to meet him and see the comedian Jeff Dunham perform. Normally I wouldnt post a review but the Buckhead Wingate just blew me away. To start the location was near everything in buckhead including Roy's and Buckhead dinner which we dined at. The building itself really doesnt do the place justice as the room was incredible. I felt like I was in some exotic location since the the room had bamboo floors, a pencil post bed with cotton canopy and both a large shower and jacuzzi tub. They had a very fun and nice bar downstairs that we spent time at watching the basketball tournament. But really the best thing about the hotel was the people. The staff including the guest services manager, Anthony, went out of the way to provide everything we needed. They actually had a big discussion on the the best way to get to the show and printed out several sets of directions (thank god!!!). I really cannot express how great they were and what a great place this was to stay.\n",

The front desk staff was helpful and friendly, our rooms were well cleaned and beautiful. The attention to details really make you want to come back here to stay again. The children loved the free limo service that was available for use within Buckhead. We made use of the cappuccino machine that made wonderful lattes, coffee, etc. 24 hours a day, and we all enjoyed the cookies in the afternoons, and not to forget the great waffles in the morning for breakfast.  The rooms were spacious and the shower was heavenly. We stayed in a king bedroom suite, which is worth the money.  We advise anyone staying in Atlanta to stay at this Wingate.

The staff is very friendly. They greet you when you enter and leave. The rooms are nicely appointed and you get nearly all the amenities of an upscale hotel. Breakfasts include cooked to order omelets and waffles. Coffee and tea is available throughout the day as well as fresh fruit. There are no hidden fees. Fax, phone, printer, high speed internet is all included with your stay. A real plus here is that there is a complimentary shuttle available to take you where you need to go. Impossible to believe you get all of this for such a reasonable price. Be aware that many hotels in the Buckhead neighborhood charge for on-site parking. At Wingate it is free. Yes, I'll indeed be back.\n",

      "  Review : My fiancee and I stayed at the Wingate Buckhead from Saturday until Friday since I needed to be in the Atlanta area for business. The location of the hotel was decent, without too much that you could walk to easily, but a park that you could run to, and very close for driving to anything. It was also very easy to get on GA-400 for my drive to work every morning.The car service was very convenient for my fiancee as I would be at work with the rental car all day, and it would allow her to do some shopping at Lennox Square or other locations very easily, and the drivers were very friendly. She was also able to walk to get lunch or coffee, but it was a longer walk than most people would want to deal with. The hotel gym, while small, was also in full working order (a rarity in hotels I find), the breakfast bar had a good selection of items and a nice, automated espresso machine, and it had a nice business center with printers available to use (though a computer on the hotel network kept trying to infect my PC with a virus, which I worry could be one of the hotel computers as they had no anti-virus software installed on them).However, there were a few problems with the hotel. The worst case happened on Sunday morning, which was the day we lost an hour due to Daylight Savings Time. We got a late start on our weekend run and went out to the Silver Comet Trail (very nice place for running or biking), did our 12 miles, and came back to the hotel. We went to shower (right around noon, due to the late start) and there was no water pressure. After calling the front desk, the woman informed us that, yes, there was no hot water in the hotel right now, and wouldn't be for a couple of hours at least. I asked if they were going to tell us this, and she said they were just starting to call people now (after turning it off, but not before), and if there was another option available to us (a local gym, for example). I was told there was no option, that it would be back in a few hours. Well, this was our main weekend day to spend in Atlanta, and we obviously didn't smell too good after that run, so it was a huge issue for us that they seemed to make no attempt to solve. Water was not restored until around 6:30 PM, which would have been too late to go almost anywhere on a Sunday (we wound up washing ourselves down with cold water and washcloths, and using lots of deodorant).In addition, the windows if you are facing the main road are not very sound dampening, so you can hear the traffic along the busy road very well, even with the curtain closed. The door to the room had a lot of space between the floor and the door, so sound in the hallway would easily come into the room and disturb you. There was also a lot of noise from the pipes when your neighbors would use the water as well.In conclusion, for the Buckhead area, the hotel is probably a pretty good value, but I would try a different hotel in the future if I was there due to these issues.\n",

      "  Review : A colleague and I stayed for 1 night on business. The rooms are just about perfectly designed & appointed for comfort and getting work done. My landline phone didn't work but there was also a cordless. The free limo service within 3 miles was very helpful, although you can't book in advance and should allow plenty of time in case you have to wait for a driver. The hotel is close to the Buckhead MARTA station, so you can take MARTA from the airport and then call the hotel for pickup. Again, we waited 20-30 minutes average each time we needed a ride, but fortunately were not on a tight timeline. The staff was very friendly, and I appreciated the complimentary full breakfast and free WiFi as much for the quick convenience as for the cost savings. WiFi was very slow in our rooms at times.Overall, a fine stay and far superior in all respects (except location) to the Hilton Atlanta, where we had to move for business reasons for the remainder of our stay.The neighborhood around the Wingate is more busy streets than pedestrian-friendly. Good thing there's a driver because there is little or nothing within walking distance, and not a pleasant walk. But our purpose was to stay someplace conducive to rest and work, and this was perfect.\n",

      "  Review : When my husband and I decided on a weekend of R&R in Atlanta, I looked at TripAdvisor to find a hotel with great reviews. When I read all the reviews of the Wingate Inn Buckhead, I was skeptical that all the fine remarks were accurate, but booked the trip anyway.Everything I read that was positive about the hotel was true and more. From the moment Marquis checked us in until Bonn checked us out, our experience was A+ all the way.The hotel was clean, smelled fresh, and our room was gorgeous! I loved having hardwood floors with an area rug instead of carpeting. We made good use of the refrigerator and would have made coffee in the room except their was always fresh coffee in the lobby. The bed was comfortable and I loved the recliner. But the best feature was the shower! I kept remembering that Atlanta had a water shortage last year, so I tried to keep my shower time to a minimum, but the shower head was so great that I had to make myself get out!The breakfast was delicious with made to order omlets, sausage links, and cranberry walnut muffins being my favorites. The fresh cookies in the lobby were equally delicious with chocolate chip being my top pick. We didn't visit the bar or the pool & Jacuzzi, but they both were attractive, clean and well kept. And there really was a Lincoln stretch limo ready and waiting to take my husband and me anywhere within a 3-mile radious of the hotel. The location of this hotel was great for us and easy to get to. We felt safe and secure leaving our car in the well lit parking lot which is not always the case in a large city.I would stay there again and highly recommend this property to anyone traveling in the North Atlanta area. Kudos to the Wingate Inn Atlanta Buckhead!\n",

      "  Review : The Wingate Buckhead hosted 37 of our guests plus the wedding party for our daughter's wedding. My husband and I cannot say enough here about the exvellent accomadations provided. The staff from the first person to the last was friendly , considerate, and went out of their way to make each guest feel special. With that many people we got nothing but kudos for the whole weekend.Not one negative comment! We will , and our guests will, return each time in Atlanta.  Mr. and Mrs. John L. Nelson Tampa, Fla\n",

      "  Review : Booked the Wingate for my first visit to Atlanta based upon great TripAdvisor reviews and reasonable room rates. This was a 3 night stay for myself and 2 work colleagues.From the outside the hotel is fairly unprepossessing, save the large stretch limo parked outside - more of that later.Inside the hotel, the lobby area is pleasant but not spectacular. The bar is small and to the side of the seating area used for breakfast, adequate but not really a place one would look to retire to for an evening's entertainment I suggest.Impressions start to improve as soon as you meet the front desk staff, extremely eager to please, helpful and polite - Eric deserves a menton in particular. Then you start to notice the little extras which do make this hotel realy stand out as a \"3 star ++\" - one favourite was the always available - and free to use - capuccino machine which prepared an excellent cup of coffee.The bedrooms are large and comfortable and very well looked after. There is a small fitness room (more air-con please!) and a small pool and hot tub out the back for warmer months. There is a business centre with free to use internet and printers.The inclusive breakfast was a hot / cold buffet which was very well received by all of us.Eric came up with excellent restaurant and shopping tips - Buckhead has a plentiful supply of high quality establishments. What really wowed us was the free-to-use super strech limo for guests within the Buckhead area. We made use of this daily and it really was a brilliant way to get around, they even provide free pick ups in the locality (up to 11pm). There is no booking, first come first served but this was never a problem in practice.In concluson this is not the Ritz but it does what it does extremely well and I have no hestiation to recommend to others. The limo service and front desk team really made this place worthy of top marks. Keep it up!\n",

      "  Review : We were at the hotel for four days for a meeting. We were delighted with the pleasantness and wonderful attention from the staff. (The superb breakfast and the really comfortable atmosphere were great, too.) I was most impressed when one of my coworkers found that her father had been airlifted to a trauma center (and later died). The staff went out of their way to get her to the airport and showed wonderful encouragement and compassion to her in this very difficult time. Fortunately, as a result of their prompt response (along with that of the airline) she was able to make it to the hospital before her father died. She has commented that the assistance and support, particularly of Anthony Hines-Tecoy, made a tragic circumstance almost bearable.\n",

      "  Review : My recent stay at the Wingate by Wyndham in Buckhead GA was fantastic. We had arrived at 11am, which was before normal check-in time, as my wife was feeling ill,. Once the staff realized this, they went to great effort to accommodate her needs by placing us in a great room within 10 minutes of our arrival. Anthony Hines-Tecoy, the sales and services manager, and his staff were all very helpful throughout our 2-day stay: 1. They kept asking about my wife's health to see if there was anything she needed; 2. They provided me with rides to my conference; 3. Their recommendations for restaurants were great; 4. The complimentary breakfast dining experience was wonderful, the best I have ever seen at any hotel! They provided a chef, who was excellent, as well as a wide selection of foods and beverages. I will definitely stay there again, anytime that I have to be in Atlanta, even though I know that I can stay at another Wingate nearby for less. The cost difference is well worth it in every way! The VIP treatment by the hotel staff upon our arrival; the room's decor, comfort, and ambiance; the walking accessibility of restaurants; the free rides in their Escalade.I highly recommend the Wingate by Wyndham in Buckhead GA, and their number for reservations is 404.704.4516\n",

Even people who were not directly helping said \"hello\" and \"thank you\" and \"welcome\" and were ready to accommodate however they needed to. And I'm not just talking average friendly.......this place was Fabulous. They are clean, professional, reliable and they have best damn service I've seen in years. I've traveled in and our of this country and I've not had Caribbean Resorts treat me this nice. Awesome hotel. If you are able to stay in Buckhead...stay here. You'll love it!\n",

This was a very nice cheaper alternative that gave me everything I needed and still let me feel like I was staying in a luxury hotel.The staff was also very helpful.The one thing I would point out is that the parking in the back of the hotel is a bit scary at night if you are alone. I did not feel like anyone would know if someone came up to me out there. Luckily, I was able to find a parking spot by the door.\n",

The breakfast that was raved about is typical motel continental breakfast with the addition of hot plates of eggs and bacon and sausage -dried out bacon at 8.30am- no better no worse than any other.Not very appetizing.\n",

      "  Review : I just read the most recent review of this Hotel and was pretty surprised by the comments. My family and I stayed at this Hotel this past New Year's Eve (12/31/07) while in town for the Chick Fil A Bowl. It's rare that a Hotel lives up to its rating, I mean how many do? This one did. The front desk had us registered and ready to go in less than 3 minutes, that in itself was fairly extraordinary. Fairly unfamiliar with the Atlanta area we asked Marquis at the front desk for some tips getting to and from the GA Dome. He gave us instructions as to what stops to take, where to transfer, and where to find a cab on the return trip. He arranged for the Hotel limo to drop us off at the Marta station. We followed his instructions and didn't have the first problem (did I mention it was New Year's Eve?) Marquis also provided us with suggestions of where to eat and directions to get there. I was blown away by the level of customer service. \"My Pleasure\" was heard on more than one occasion from their front desk employees.Our room was immaculate and everthing it was advertised to be. It was well decorated and had more amenities than you would expect from a 3 star Hotel. Let me give you a little insight, I am extremely picky , to the point of having fairly unrealistic expectations and this room was exceptional. You could audibly hear my husband and son's sigh of relief when they saw my reaction to our room.The free American breaskfast served the next morning was hot, delicious and plentiful. Let me say one more time, it was New Year's weekend. I concede that rooms vary so it is not outside the realm of possibility that a bad room exists at this Hotel, but that was not our experience. Could the desk have been unattended at some time or another? Sure, but again, we just didn't see it while we were there. The common areas of the Hotel were clean and well decorated and every employee that we encountered was friendly and courteous. I know I'm overdoing the reminder that it was New Year's Eve, but if they were able to provide this kind of experience during a time that is typically prone to drunken guests, overbooking and the problems those can bring, then they have to be doing something right. We will definitely stay at this Hotel when we are in the Atlanta area again, without question.\n",

The room smelled soo bad and everything looked sooo old. We were up all night because we could hear people arguing in the hallway and we could hear people next door. We had reservations for 5 nights and we checked out immediately the following morning. We booked a room at the ITERCONTINENTAL BUCKHEAD what an amazing hotel for the same price..\n",

      "  Review : I stayed at this hotel after a long flight from Ireland on 9th Dec. All the good things I read on Tripadvisor was absolutely correct. I was picked up at Buckhead station by their complimentary car service within a 3km radius and the hotel and room was very clean and comfortable with double beds and all mod cons. Breakfast was fantastic with lots of choice and a great chef who made the most fantastic Belgian waffles(malt as the magic ingredient). If you have a stay in Atlanta stay here. There are also great restaurants near the hotel and of course the hotel drive you there and back in their limousine.\n",

      "  Review : My wife and other family members stayed here during the Veteran's Day weekend and found that the Wingate Inn is probably the best value you can find in Atlanta.THE DOWN SIDES: Only minor detailsNo Bell Service: There is no bell service here. Therefore, you will need to have to carry your own bags to your rooms. However, they do have luggage carts for you to use.No Exhaust Fan Controls: In my room there was no control for the exhaust fan and it was annoying to hear it all night.The Double Beds: The double beds are not queen size but are a little bigger than full size. Therefore, they may not be the most comfortable for use by a couple.THE UP SIDES: Everything Else.The Double Beds and sheets: The double beds are well equipped with luxurious comforters and wonderful pillows. You get more than enough pillows on the beds. Moreover, I slept wonderfully. The bed are very COMFORTABLE .The Free Espresso and cappuccinos: In the lobby area there is a wonderful super automatic es[presso machine. You may use it 24 hours a day. It's great. Great for Business Traveler: Each room is wired for internet and WiFi is free. Moreover, there is a computer room where you have free access to the internet.The Toiletries: Penhaligon's of London supplies them and they are wonderful. The Breakfast: The breakfast is great.The Staff and The Mascot: We found the staff to be great but not perfect. They were able to address questions we had and suggested great places to eat. Also, I noticed that every now and a HUGE German Sheppard would be hanging out in the manager's office. He seemed friendly and at home.Conclusion: Overall the experience was great.\n",

      "  Review : I cannot stress how much I enjoyed my stay at the Wingate. We stayed in Room 527 (Smoking Suite). It was not the dirty smoking rooms that you usually get, we had hardwood floors and there was only one cigarette burn in the whole place, and it was small. The spa tub was HUGE, could easily fit 4 people. But the best part was Anthony Hines-Tecoy. He answered endless emails from me in preparing for my stay and he was absolutely wonderful in seeing that all of the details were taken care of. We go the romance package that included champagne, chocolates and dinner. This was a great idea, it is only about $70 more than the room alone, and you get to choose the area restaurant that you want to go to (in the form of a $100 gift card). This worked out perfect. And every room comes with limousine transportation in the Buckhead area so that you can get wasted at dinner and not have to worry about driving back to the hotel. This was a wonderful romantic night out and I would recommend it to anyone. CALL ANTHONY he was fantastic!\n",

The rooms are excellent and all the facilities made for a great stay. All the staff at the hotel could not have been more helpful, Marquis made us laugh and definately deserves a raise!! The breakfasts were great, free rides to and from places within 3 miles, 2 computers and printer to use, free parking, great coffee 24/7 and pool and hot tub. I cannot understand the previous reviewer, we thought this place represented excellent value for money, definately better than 3 stars. The whole place was so clean.Buckhead is a modern clean area with great shopping and dining. If you are near to this place or not make an effort to stay here, you wont regret it. Overall the best hotel we have stayed in, and we've stayed in a lot!! Paul and Jan.\n",

      "  Review : After reading the reviews previously posted here, I was really surprised at how poor the Wingate Buckhead was. It's an okay hotel, but for $175+ a night, I expect a bit more. Upon arrival I was informed they had my \"smoking king\" all ready. Wrong! I had booked (and had my confirmation) of a king NON-smoking. All I got was an \"Oh.\" from the desk clerk. After entering my room, I find out that I now have two double beds. Why didn't the front desk clerk tell me he was putting me in a double? They also didn't tell me that they would be renovating the workout center while I was there--good thing I packed workout clothes and tennis shoes. As a self-described, business-centered hotel, why is there no ATM? The bar is convenient for a nightcap, but be prepared to shell out the big bucks. A double B&B ran me over $20!! Alone, none of these issues would be a problem, but put them all together and you get an not-so-great stay. Very disappointing.\n",

      "  Review : This was easily one of the best hotel experiences I've had. The desk staff was very friendly at check in, the complimentary breakfast was delicious with made to order omelets, waffles, standard continental breakfast fare and a cappucino/latte machine. I believe the chef we had for the 3 days we were there was named F.M. Moore (guess I should have done this sooner). He was very friendly, and even had the courtesy to remember where we were from and asked how we enjoyed the sites we had planned on seeing.Our room was spacious and very clean, with a wonderful bed, plenty of hot water, free high speed internet, and a view of the pool. The hardwood floor and oriental rug were a nice touch. We loved that we had a microwave and a fridge, but only used the fridge for water and soda as we never had leftovers. Sambuca Jazz Cafe is just down the road and if you've never been I highly recommend it. This was our second time,great food and great live music. Not cheap, but this is Buckhead. However if you go for the 1st seating from 5:30-6:30pm, they do offer a 3 course meal for $20.Since we rented a car we didn't have need for the limos, but it was nice to know that they were there if we need to go somewhere. It was also nice to not have to pay for parking. All in all, a great time and I would not hesitate to stay here again.\n",

      "  Review : I stayed at this property for one night while in town for a concert at Chastain Park. It was the perfect location since it was only minutes from the venue, and we were chauffeured there and back! I am used to staying in downtown Atlanta when there, and I will admit that I missed feeling more like I was in \"the city\" (the hotel only has five floors for instance), but I saved a bundle on parking since the hotel parking was free and no parking at the concert either! The staff was extremely nice, the rooms were very clean, and I liked the wood floors much better than I thought I would. (The oriental rug was a nice touch!) My only issue was that I did not splurge on a suite with a whirlpool tub, but I thought from the pictures that the regular rooms still had the very nice looking shower that was pictured. Wrong - It was just a regular shower. And I had hoped to take advantage of the complimentary breakfast too, but it ended at 10:00 which was a little too early to be up and out so I wish it would have lasted until at least 10:30, but those are the only few issues I had. I would definitely stay here again the next time I am going to Chastain!\n",

      "  Review : I arrived at Buckhead MARTA station (N7) from the airport, and calledthe hotel to request a free pick up fully expecting to be toldthat as I hadn’t checked in yet I’d have to find my own way there. On the contrary, I was warmly greeted and informed that the driver would be with me momentarily and so she was. Good start. From that moment on, my intitial impressions were only reinforced. The reception staff were friendly and professional, always welcoming and willing to help. The rooms are comfortable and had everything needed including complimentary wi-fi broad band. Breakfast was more than adequate with cereals and fruit and the usual cooked goodies. Then there were cookies in the afternoon to go with the complimentary coffe and tea. All in all, they couldn't do enough for you - that's rare these days so thank you Desi, Alan, Anthony, Sherri and Cory, I am so looking forward to the next time.\n",

      "  Review : We just got back from a weekend in Atlanta at the Wingate and had an excellent experience. The hotel itself was above average with some very nice extras like the breakfast and evening bar. But the best thing about this hotel is by far the management. Anthony is the best manager we have come in contact with in a long time. The fact that you even come in contact with a manager is rare nowadays. He went out of his way to make sure we were well taken care of and sometimes we can seem a bit high maintenance. Anytime we are in Atlanta we will stay here as long as Anthony is there and as good as he is, that may not be long.\n",

      "  Review : This is probably the best value hotel you will ever find! My boyfriend and I booked our stay on the hotel website for about $101 per night. For that very low price, you get the following: - Free breakfast, including made-to-order omelettes, bacon, cereal, coffee, etc. We were so stuffed that we had to skip lunch one day!- Free use of their workout room and pools- Free wi-fi in the hotel room- Free use of their 2-3 computers and printers (which came in handy when we purchased our tickets to the Georgia Aquarium, World of Coca-Cola, and a Braves game)- Courteous front desk staff...talk about Southern hospitality!- Good-sized, clean rooms with hardwood floors- Great location- Free limo service (Cadillac Escalades, SUV limo, stretch limo) within 3 miles of the hotel (until 11pm)...our favorite perk!The free limo service was a very convenient feature. The drivers were very courteous and helpful. They drove us to restaurants, train stations, shopping centers, etc. (anywhere within 3 miles). They also gave us their phone numbers, so that we can call them to get picked up! We never had to take any cabs, which saved us a lot of money. One time, we had asked them to pick us up from the Buckhead train station. However, we did not realize that we had gone on the wrong train line. We had called them to inform them of our mistake and they went out of their way to pick us up at the train station we ended up at. Talk about great service!The front desk staff are true examples of Southern hospitality. After we had checked out of our hotel around 11am, we had about 1.5 hrs to kill before our lunch reservations. We were fine with just hanging out in the lobby and reading some magazines. However, the front desk decided to go above and beyond! They had called housekeeping to delay turn service and gave us keys to our room again (even after we just checked out)...just in case we wanted to hang out and watch TV for a little bit. They also did some research and gave us some recommendations on things to do nearby. I was very impressed!Wingate Inn Atlanta Buckhead has definitely set the bar high! Next time I'm in Atlanta, I know where I'll be staying!\n",

      "  Review : This is a good hotel. The staff are lovely, they call you by name when they see you. They defininately know how to treat people. The free limo rides are wonderful, and the drivers are excellent, you feel like royalty!I only have one complaint, the first room we were given was near the lift. It was Saturday night and the hotel was busy. We found that people were coming back from their night out, standing outside the lift and and having a conversation, before going to bed, this went on until about 3.00a.m. The next day I asked if we could change rooms, away from the lift. This was done really quickly. They got another room cleaned and we were moved in within 2hrs. Unfortunately I think, either the hotel has thin walls, or we were just unlucky with noisy neighbours, but we could still hear other people quite loudly in the night. I didn't ask to be moved again as we were only there for 5 nights, and overall we enjoyed the hotel.The pool area is nice, and we liked Buckhead.\n",

This hotel is excellent value and offers a number of free extras - internet, breakfast, safe, tea making facilities- that you wouldn't necessarily get in more expensive hotels. The complimentary shuttle is certainly something worth having - we went to to the shopping malls, local restaurants and the local subway from where we could get easily to other sights in Atlanta. Overall for what we paid it was well worth every penny. Downsides? people being allowed in the pool area when they get back from concerts when the rest of us are trying to sleep. But don't let that put you off.\n",

      "  Review : I organized our company off-site which took place May 16-18, 2007 at the Wingate Inn Buckhead. Every one in our 50+ group totally enjoyed the hotel. The rooms and meeting facilities were impecable, the breakfast and food service was excellent. We enjoyed our breaks and lunch in the beautiful outdoor pool area and when the days sessions were complete we took advantage of the lovely hotel bar. Most importantly of all Burges and his team anticipated our needs and always went that extra mile; I have organized too many company meetings to count and this is the highest quality of service I have ever experienced. The hotel organized our transport to/from the airport and our large group activities it was all completely flawless, the hotel limousines ferried us wherever we wanted to go in the neighborhood. The entire crew at the Wingate Inn Buckhead are true professionals and I would for business and pleasure be staying at the Wingate when next in Atlanta.\n",

We booked using credit card travel points but got the same rate as the hotel web site. Our room did not have the wood floors mentioned elsewhere but was lovely and had a small fridge and coffeemaker. Bed was very comfortable and even though we faced a busy Piedmont Road, we had no problems with noise. We had a really nice breakfast in the lobby the next morning - the espresso maker gave me a decent, if slightly messy, latte. For the price, this was a super- excellent value. I can find nothing to complain about at all.\n",

      "  Review : Visited this hotel in March of 2007, stayed for a week on a business trip to Atlanta. This was my first stay at a Wingte Inn. What a great hotel - from the start at check in, Anthony at the front desk was very friendly and couteous and checked us in quickly. The rooms are just great - not your typical hotel room as they have hardwood floors so the rooms feel brighter and more open then you typical hotel with dark carpeting with all kinds of odors.I'll let the photos speak for themselves, but the bed was just amazing - a wonderful king bed with amazing linens and covers and lots of pillows. The room had a separte sitting area, desk, and very small kitchenette with microwave and fridge.The bathroom was spacious and best of all the water pressure was very nice and the showerhead was also great, provided lots of water when showeing - not those skimpy shower heads that it takes you a half hour to rinse off. Another great feature of this hotel is the complimentary breakfast - many options for juices, cereals, fruit, yogurt, breads and also a on-staff chef to make waffles or eggs to order. The pool area was nice as well - although not heated and in March was a bit cold to swim - but there also a outdoor jacuzzi. The only downside to my room was it had an ajoining door and the man in the room next to me spoke loud and I could easily over hear his conversation but fortunately he went to bed early and it was not an issue at night.All of the staff was very friendly and accomodating to myself and my coworker - I would definatly stay here again or at any wingate inn.\n",

      "  Review : I met my fiancee in Atlanta because he was there on a business trip. It was our first time there and a friend recommended staying in the Buckhead area for the weekend. My fiancee stayed downtown during the week for work. I am so glad we stayed in Buckhead and at the Wingate!!Our check-in was a quick and easy upon arrival and the front desk clerk was extremely friendly. Our room was spacious, clean and well equipped with the usual amenities PLUS free internet service. The room is the size of a dream studio apartment in Manhattan (where we're from). The bed was comfy enough and the curtains allowed us to sleep nice and late.The BEST amenity that put this hotel way above any other luxury hotesl was the complimentary transportation services. Anytime between 9am and 11pm, there is free transportation for guests within the Buckhead area. We were taken to dinner in a limousine and picked up in a luxury SUV. We were able to have as much alcohol as we wanted at dinner without worrying who was going to drive back to the hotel.This hotel is a steal for the room rates they offer!\n",

I was nervous because I have never stayed at a Wingate before, but read the positive reviews and figured I would give it a try.The location of the hotel is excellent. Easy to get to off the highway and located near many restaurants and stores. The Lennox mall is a five minute drive away as well. The room was clean and spacious. It had a small fridge and microwave which is extremely helpful. Free internet access was easy to use- both wired and wireless. The free breakfast was uncrowded and very good. The \"chef\" that prepares omelettes and waffles was polite and happy to cook and assist with cleanup. The only negatives were some minor damage in the room and the price. The AAA rate was still fairly high without paying the entire rate in advance.Overall I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone going to the Buckhead area.\n",

One day we didn't get up til four in the afternoon and we were still able to get housekeeping in our room to clean. The limo service was terrific. It only runs til 11 but we would come down at 10:50 and they would still take us out, even on New Year's Eve. The drivers are superb and will drive you from ATM to ATM till you find one that works. Any questions we had about the surrounding area the front desk was very helpful and gave wonderful suggestions on where to go and they were always the best spots. We are already planning on being in Buckhead next year and we are staying here again! We can't wait!!\n",

      "  Review : I stayed at the Wingate after reading several reviews and was very dissapointed, actually disgusted. I checked into the room on Saturday night and the hotel staff was very friendly. However, when I got to the room and pulled back the comforter there were several small black and curly hairs in the bed, not sure what it was, but I don't think I want to know. When I spoke with the manager he didn't really say anything or apologize, but when I asked for an upgrade he didn't deny it. So, we moved to a \"suite\" that was extremely old and worn out. There were marks all over the walls and dead bugs on the toilet and bathtub. The towels that were brought to the room the next day were torn and the edges still had dirt on them. Overall, not a clean hotel and not a good experience.\n",

They deliver courteous service, clean, quiet accommodations. Beds were great. Internet fast, free and convenient. Breakfast was quite good with range of Belgian waffles, custom omlets, plus full range of cereals, whole fresh fruit, yogurt and juice. Espresso machine was in and out of service and made mediocre java as might be expected. In room fridge and microwave nice addition with nearby shopping (Krogers, etc.). Hotel shuttle puts many amenities in reach even without a car. Lots of restaurants nearby (walking) of good to excellent quality plus variety and not overpriced as downtown majors near CNN, etc. Would stay here again definitely if in Atlanta.\n",

      "  Review : I have just returned from my trip to Buckhead. I am from New Jersey and I visit Buckhead once a year to attend Altanta Braves Baseball games. My friends and I have been traveling to Atlanta for the past four years now. We have stayed at the Crowne Plaza and this year we decided to switch to the Wingate Inn. I just want to say that this Hotel is fabulous. We were greeted with a shuttle limo awaiting us at the Marta. The staff is very helpful and the hotel is extremely neat. The rooms, bathroom, pool and bar are absolutely spotless! The beds in the rooms are so comfortable and the sheets and comforter makes you not want to get out of bed. The service to the Marta and anywhere you want to go was on the money. The one thing I have to say is that the breakfast in the morning which includes: homemade waffles and special prepared omelletes not including bacon, sausage muffins etc etc.. was a major treat. I have not been to a hotel that offered this marvelous breakfast. The pool area was beautiful especially the chairs, and the tile all around the pool. I can go on and on about this Hotel but I would recommend it to anyone. I will be staying there again and this time I will definitely stay in their suites. THeir upgrades on this hotel will catch your eye. Soon they will be adding a restaurant that I know will be superb. Check this hotel out if you are staying in Buckhead. It is affordable and for what they offer it blows all hotels away. Oh yeah by the way their bar in the lobby is wonderful and they have all top shelf liquors! Just a great time...\n",

      "  Review : I recently spent a very pleasant night at the Wingate Inn in Buckhead/Atlanta and would recommend it to others. My room (two double beds) was quite large compared to others I've recently stayed in, and included a microwave, small fridge, and coffeemaker. The room also had free wireless (or Ethernet) Internet access which was handy for working and checking email. The bathroom had upscale furnishings and the shower had great water pressure -- maybe the best I've ever had at a hotel. I didn't get a chance to try the free breakfast but did sample one of the free cookies put out during the afternoon. My only complaint is that my room faced the street and let in a lot of street noise. Luckily I can sleep through almost anything, so it didn't really bother me, but anyone who is noise-sensitive should request a room facing the back. One really nice thing I should mention is that there was a sign in the room saying that it was a non-smoking room and that anyone smoking in it would have to pay a $200 \"cleaning fee.\" As a non-smoker who gets very irritated when given a smoky-smelling non-smoking room or rental car, I was very glad to see this sign! And sure enough, there was absolutely no track of smoke in the room.\n",

      "  Review : We just got home from a one night stay. Nice hotel, convenient to everything in the Buckhead area. However, ominous signs in parking lot and waiver of liability at check-in should have given me an idea that something was up. Sure enough, our Tahoe was broken into with a tool that goes in behind the lock and disables the alarm. We lost a lot of HIDDEN items, digital cameras, etc. Three cars were hit last night (09/05/05), and the police officer responding said that this hotel was BAD for this, and that they did not respond to the suggestion to put up a security camera or post a guard. He had been there even the day before working other car break-ins! They just get their waiver of responsibility and then turn a blind eye. I am on a campaign to make them offer better security in their parking lot.How much would it cost to place even DUMMY cameras in the parking lot with signs warning the thieves? Instead, they simply get their liability waivers and the rampant problem continues. The police officer told us that the authorities suspect that someone in the hotel might be even tipping off or aiding the thieves! This experience turned what would have been an excellent review into what I hope is a terrible one, warning all. Nobody could have seen into our car (tinted windows, etc.), so no car is safe in the parking lot of the Wingate Inn Atlanta Buckhead at 3600 Piedmont Road.\n",

      "  Review : This is a nice business hotel, no frills but the services and accomodations that you need for work related travel. Highlights include a nice continental breakfast, empty mini refrigerator and microwave, small but adequate work out room, and two station computer room. The biggest detractor is that the hotel is not near anything. The closest resturant is a greasy diner about a mile off, and if you want to order in you have to use the very expensive \"Dining In\" option to order from local resturants because there is no room service/resturant. You will need to rent a car if you are staying here, otherwise you will feel trapped without access to any resturants, stores etc.\n",
